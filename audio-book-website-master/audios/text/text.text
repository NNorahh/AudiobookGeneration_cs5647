"Siddhartha," he said, "we are old, and we may never meet again. My dear friend, I believe you have found peace, but I have not yet found it. Beloved one, tell me once more something I can understand! Send me on my way. Siddhartha, my path has often been hard, often dark."
Siddhartha gazed at him silently, with his usual serene smile. Govinda looked at his face with fear and longing. His eyes were full of pain, full of eternal seeking and eternal loss.
Siddhartha saw this and smiled.
"Bend down!" he whispered softly. "Come closer, bend down! Closer, closer! Kiss my forehead, Govinda!"
