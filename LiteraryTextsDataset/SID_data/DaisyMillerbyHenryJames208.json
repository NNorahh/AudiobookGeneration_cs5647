        "context": "I hardly know whether it was the analogies or the differences that were uppermost in the mind of a young American , who , two or three years ago , sat in the garden of the “ Trois Couronnes , ” looking about him , rather idly , at some of the graceful objects I have mentioned . It was a beautiful summer morning , and in whatever fashion the young American looked at things , they must have seemed to him charming . He had come from Geneva the day before by the little steamer , to see his aunt , who was staying at the hotel — Geneva having been for a long time his place of residence . But his aunt had a headache — his aunt had almost always a headache — and now she was shut up in her room , smelling camphor , so that he was at liberty to wander about . He was some seven-and-twenty years of age ; when his friends spoke of him , they usually said that he was at Geneva “ studying . ” When his enemies spoke of him , they said — but , after all , he had no enemies ; he was an extremely amiable fellow , and universally liked . What I should say is , simply , that when certain persons spoke of him they affirmed that the reason of his spending so much time at Geneva was that he was extremely devoted to a lady who lived there — a foreign lady — a person older than himself . Very few Americans — indeed , I think none — had ever seen this lady , about whom there were some singular stories . But Winterbourne had an old attachment for the little metropolis of Calvinism ; he had been put to school there as a boy , and he had afterward gone to college there — circumstances which had led to his forming a great many youthful friendships . Many of these he had kept , and they were a source of great satisfaction to him . After knocking at his aunt 's door and learning that she was indisposed , he had taken a walk about the town , and then he had come in to his breakfast . He had now finished his breakfast ; but he was drinking a small cup of coffee , which had been served to him on a little table in the garden by one of the waiters who looked like an attache . At last he finished his coffee and lit a cigarette . Presently a small boy came walking along the path — an urchin of nine or ten . The child , who was diminutive for his years , had an aged expression of countenance , a pale complexion , and sharp little features . He was dressed in knickerbockers , with red stockings , which displayed his poor little spindle-shanks ; he also wore a brilliant red cravat . He carried in his hand a long alpenstock , the sharp point of which he thrust into everything that he approached — the flowerbeds , the garden benches , the trains of the ladies ’ dresses . In front of Winterbourne he paused , looking at him with a pair of bright , penetrating little eyes . “ Will you give me a lump of sugar ? ” he asked in a sharp , hard little voice — a voice immature and yet , somehow , not young . Winterbourne glanced at the small table near him , on which his coffee service rested , and saw that several morsels of sugar remained . “ Yes , you may take one , ” he answered ; “ but I do n't think sugar is good for little boys . ” This little boy stepped forward and carefully selected three of the coveted fragments , two of which he buried in the pocket of his knickerbockers , depositing the other as promptly in another place . He poked his alpenstock , lance-fashion , into Winterbourne 's bench and tried to crack the lump of sugar with his teeth . “ Oh , blazes ; it 's har-r-d ! ” he exclaimed , pronouncing the adjective in a peculiar manner . Winterbourne had immediately perceived that he might have the honor of claiming him as a fellow countryman . “ Take care you do n't hurt your teeth , ” he said , paternally . “ I have n't got any teeth to hurt . They have all come out . I have only got seven teeth . My mother counted them last night , and one came out right afterward . She said she 'd slap me if any more came out . I can n't help it . It 's this old Europe . It 's the climate that makes them come out . In America they did n't come out . It 's these hotels . ”",

The young lady meanwhile had drawn near . She was dressed in white muslin , with a hundred frills and flounces , and knots of pale-colored ribbon . She was bareheaded , but she balanced in her hand a large parasol , with a deep border of embroidery ; and she was strikingly , admirably pretty . “ How pretty they are ! ” thought Winterbourne , straightening himself in his seat , as if he were prepared to rise . The young lady paused in front of his bench , near the parapet of the garden , which overlooked the lake . The little boy had now converted his alpenstock into a vaulting pole , by the aid of which he was springing about in the gravel and kicking it up not a little . “ Randolph , ” said the young lady , “ what ARE you doing ? ” “ I 'm going up the Alps , ” replied Randolph . “ This is the way ! ” And he gave another little jump , scattering the pebbles about Winterbourne 's ears . “ That 's the way they come down , ” said Winterbourne . “ He 's an American man ! ” cried Randolph , in his little hard voice . The young lady gave no heed to this announcement , but looked straight at her brother . “ Well , I guess you had better be quiet , ” she simply observed . It seemed to Winterbourne that he had been in a manner presented . He got up and stepped slowly toward the young girl , throwing away his cigarette . “ This little boy and I have made acquaintance , ” he said , with great civility . In Geneva , as he had been perfectly aware , a young man was not at liberty to speak to a young unmarried lady except under certain rarely occurring conditions ; but here at Vevey , what conditions could be better than these ?— a pretty American girl coming and standing in front of you in a garden . This pretty American girl , however , on hearing Winterbourne 's observation , simply glanced at him ; she then turned her head and looked over the parapet , at the lake and the opposite mountains . He wondered whether he had gone too far , but he decided that he must advance farther , rather than retreat . While he was thinking of something else to say , the young lady turned to the little boy again . “ I should like to know where you got that pole , ” she said .",

I want to go to America . ” “ Oh , Italy is a beautiful place ! ” rejoined the young man . “ Can you get candy there ? ” Randolph loudly inquired . “ I hope not , ” said his sister . “ I guess you have had enough candy , and mother thinks so too . ” “ I have n't had any for ever so long — for a hundred weeks ! ” cried the boy , still jumping about .",

He got up and stepped slowly toward the young girl , throwing away his cigarette . “ This little boy and I have made acquaintance , ” he said , with great civility . In Geneva , as he had been perfectly aware , a young man was not at liberty to speak to a young unmarried lady except under certain rarely occurring conditions ; but here at Vevey , what conditions could be better than these ?— a pretty American girl coming and standing in front of you in a garden . This pretty American girl , however , on hearing Winterbourne 's observation , simply glanced at him ; she then turned her head and looked over the parapet , at the lake and the opposite mountains . He wondered whether he had gone too far , but he decided that he must advance farther , rather than retreat . While he was thinking of something else to say , the young lady turned to the little boy again . “ I should like to know where you got that pole , ” she said . “ I bought it , ” responded Randolph . “ You do n't mean to say you 're going to take it to Italy ? ” “ Yes , I am going to take it to Italy , ” the child declared . The young girl glanced over the front of her dress and smoothed out a knot or two of ribbon . Then she rested her eyes upon the prospect again . “ Well , I guess you had better leave it somewhere , ” she said after a moment . “ Are you going to Italy ? ” Winterbourne inquired in a tone of great respect . The young lady glanced at him again . “ Yes , sir , ” she replied .

The young lady inspected her flounces and smoothed her ribbons again ; and Winterbourne presently risked an observation upon the beauty of the view . He was ceasing to be embarrassed , for he had begun to perceive that she was not in the least embarrassed herself . There had not been the slightest alteration in her charming complexion ; she was evidently neither offended nor flattered . If she looked another way when he spoke to her , and seemed not particularly to hear him , this was simply her habit , her manner . Yet , as he talked a little more and pointed out some of the objects of interest in the view , with which she appeared quite unacquainted , she gradually gave him more of the benefit of her glance ; and then he saw that this glance was perfectly direct and unshrinking . It was not , however , what would have been called an immodest glance , for the young girl 's eyes were singularly honest and fresh . They were wonderfully pretty eyes ; and , indeed , Winterbourne had not seen for a long time anything prettier than his fair countrywoman 's various features — her complexion , her nose , her ears , her teeth . He had a great relish for feminine beauty ; he was addicted to observing and analyzing it ; and as regards this young lady 's face he made several observations . It was not at all insipid , but it was not exactly expressive ; and though it was eminently delicate , Winterbourne mentally accused it — very forgivingly — of a want of finish . He thought it very possible that Master Randolph 's sister was a coquette ; he was sure she had a spirit of her own ; but in her bright , sweet , superficial little visage there was no mockery , no irony . Before long it became obvious that she was much disposed toward conversation . She told him that they were going to Rome for the winter — she and her mother and Randolph . She asked him if he was a “ real American ” ; she should n't have taken him for one ; he seemed more like a German — this was said after a little hesitation — especially when he spoke . Winterbourne , laughing , answered that he had met Germans who spoke like Americans , but that he had not , so far as he remembered , met an American who spoke like a German . Then he asked her if she should not be more comfortable in sitting upon the bench which he had just quitted . She answered that she liked standing up and walking about ; but she presently sat down . She told him she was from New York State — “ if you know where that is . ” Winterbourne learned more about her by catching hold of her small , slippery brother and making him stand a few minutes by his side .",

        "context": "It seemed to Winterbourne that he had been in a manner presented . He got up and stepped slowly toward the young girl , throwing away his cigarette . “ This little boy and I have made acquaintance , ” he said , with great civility . In Geneva , as he had been perfectly aware , a young man was not at liberty to speak to a young unmarried lady except under certain rarely occurring conditions ; but here at Vevey , what conditions could be better than these ?— a pretty American girl coming and standing in front of you in a garden . This pretty American girl , however , on hearing Winterbourne 's observation , simply glanced at him ; she then turned her head and looked over the parapet , at the lake and the opposite mountains . He wondered whether he had gone too far , but he decided that he must advance farther , rather than retreat . While he was thinking of something else to say , the young lady turned to the little boy again . “ I should like to know where you got that pole , ” she said . “ I bought it , ” responded Randolph . “ You do n't mean to say you 're going to take it to Italy ? ” “ Yes , I am going to take it to Italy , ” the child declared . The young girl glanced over the front of her dress and smoothed out a knot or two of ribbon . Then she rested her eyes upon the prospect again . “ Well , I guess you had better leave it somewhere , ” she said after a moment . “ Are you going to Italy ? ” Winterbourne inquired in a tone of great respect . The young lady glanced at him again . “ Yes , sir , ” she replied . And she said nothing more . “ Are you — a — going over the Simplon ? ” Winterbourne pursued , a little embarrassed . “ I do n't know , ” she said . “ I suppose it 's some mountain . Randolph , what mountain are we going over ? ” “ Going where ? ” the child demanded . “ To Italy , ” Winterbourne explained . “ I do n't know , ” said Randolph . “ I do n't want to go to Italy . I want to go to America . ” “ Oh , Italy is a beautiful place ! ” rejoined the young man . “ Can you get candy there ? ” Randolph loudly inquired . “ I hope not , ” said his sister . “ I guess you have had enough candy , and mother thinks so too . ” “ I have n't had any for ever so long — for a hundred weeks ! ” cried the boy , still jumping about . The young lady inspected her flounces and smoothed her ribbons again ; and Winterbourne presently risked an observation upon the beauty of the view . He was ceasing to be embarrassed , for he had begun to perceive that she was not in the least embarrassed herself . There had not been the slightest alteration in her charming complexion ; she was evidently neither offended nor flattered . If she looked another way when he spoke to her , and seemed not particularly to hear him , this was simply her habit , her manner . Yet , as he talked a little more and pointed out some of the objects of interest in the view , with which she appeared quite unacquainted , she gradually gave him more of the benefit of her glance ; and then he saw that this glance was perfectly direct and unshrinking . It was not , however , what would have been called an immodest glance , for the young girl 's eyes were singularly honest and fresh . They were wonderfully pretty eyes ; and , indeed , Winterbourne had not seen for a long time anything prettier than his fair countrywoman 's various features — her complexion , her nose , her ears , her teeth . He had a great relish for feminine beauty ; he was addicted to observing and analyzing it ; and as regards this young lady 's face he made several observations . It was not at all insipid , but it was not exactly expressive ; and though it was eminently delicate , Winterbourne mentally accused it — very forgivingly — of a want of finish . He thought it very possible that Master Randolph 's sister was a coquette ; he was sure she had a spirit of her own ; but in her bright , sweet , superficial little visage there was no mockery , no irony . Before long it became obvious that she was much disposed toward conversation . She told him that they were going to Rome for the winter — she and her mother and Randolph . She asked him if he was a “ real American ” ; she should n't have taken him for one ; he seemed more like a German — this was said after a little hesitation — especially when he spoke . Winterbourne , laughing , answered that he had met Germans who spoke like Americans , but that he had not , so far as he remembered , met an American who spoke like a German . Then he asked her if she should not be more comfortable in sitting upon the bench which he had just quitted . She answered that she liked standing up and walking about ; but she presently sat down . She told him she was from New York State — “ if you know where that is . ” Winterbourne learned more about her by catching hold of her small , slippery brother and making him stand a few minutes by his side .",

        "context": "It seemed to Winterbourne that he had been in a manner presented . He got up and stepped slowly toward the young girl , throwing away his cigarette . “ This little boy and I have made acquaintance , ” he said , with great civility . In Geneva , as he had been perfectly aware , a young man was not at liberty to speak to a young unmarried lady except under certain rarely occurring conditions ; but here at Vevey , what conditions could be better than these ?— a pretty American girl coming and standing in front of you in a garden . This pretty American girl , however , on hearing Winterbourne 's observation , simply glanced at him ; she then turned her head and looked over the parapet , at the lake and the opposite mountains . He wondered whether he had gone too far , but he decided that he must advance farther , rather than retreat . While he was thinking of something else to say , the young lady turned to the little boy again . “ I should like to know where you got that pole , ” she said . “ I bought it , ” responded Randolph . “ You do n't mean to say you 're going to take it to Italy ? ” “ Yes , I am going to take it to Italy , ” the child declared . The young girl glanced over the front of her dress and smoothed out a knot or two of ribbon . Then she rested her eyes upon the prospect again . “ Well , I guess you had better leave it somewhere , ” she said after a moment . “ Are you going to Italy ? ” Winterbourne inquired in a tone of great respect . The young lady glanced at him again . “ Yes , sir , ” she replied . And she said nothing more . “ Are you — a — going over the Simplon ? ” Winterbourne pursued , a little embarrassed . “ I do n't know , ” she said . “ I suppose it 's some mountain . Randolph , what mountain are we going over ? ” “ Going where ? ” the child demanded . “ To Italy , ” Winterbourne explained . “ I do n't know , ” said Randolph . “ I do n't want to go to Italy . I want to go to America . ” “ Oh , Italy is a beautiful place ! ” rejoined the young man . “ Can you get candy there ? ” Randolph loudly inquired . “ I hope not , ” said his sister . “ I guess you have had enough candy , and mother thinks so too . ” “ I have n't had any for ever so long — for a hundred weeks ! ” cried the boy , still jumping about .

He was ceasing to be embarrassed , for he had begun to perceive that she was not in the least embarrassed herself . There had not been the slightest alteration in her charming complexion ; she was evidently neither offended nor flattered . If she looked another way when he spoke to her , and seemed not particularly to hear him , this was simply her habit , her manner . Yet , as he talked a little more and pointed out some of the objects of interest in the view , with which she appeared quite unacquainted , she gradually gave him more of the benefit of her glance ; and then he saw that this glance was perfectly direct and unshrinking . It was not , however , what would have been called an immodest glance , for the young girl 's eyes were singularly honest and fresh . They were wonderfully pretty eyes ; and , indeed , Winterbourne had not seen for a long time anything prettier than his fair countrywoman 's various features — her complexion , her nose , her ears , her teeth . He had a great relish for feminine beauty ; he was addicted to observing and analyzing it ; and as regards this young lady 's face he made several observations . It was not at all insipid , but it was not exactly expressive ; and though it was eminently delicate , Winterbourne mentally accused it — very forgivingly — of a want of finish . He thought it very possible that Master Randolph 's sister was a coquette ; he was sure she had a spirit of her own ; but in her bright , sweet , superficial little visage there was no mockery , no irony . Before long it became obvious that she was much disposed toward conversation . She told him that they were going to Rome for the winter — she and her mother and Randolph . She asked him if he was a “ real American ” ; she should n't have taken him for one ; he seemed more like a German — this was said after a little hesitation — especially when he spoke . Winterbourne , laughing , answered that he had met Germans who spoke like Americans , but that he had not , so far as he remembered , met an American who spoke like a German . Then he asked her if she should not be more comfortable in sitting upon the bench which he had just quitted . She answered that she liked standing up and walking about ; but she presently sat down . She told him she was from New York State — “ if you know where that is . ” Winterbourne learned more about her by catching hold of her small , slippery brother and making him stand a few minutes by his side . “ Tell me your name , my boy , ” he said . “ Randolph C. Miller , ” said the boy sharply . “ And I 'll tell you her name ; ” and he leveled his alpenstock at his sister . “ You had better wait till you are asked ! ” said this young lady calmly . “ I should like very much to know your name , ” said Winterbourne . “ Her name is Daisy Miller ! ” cried the child . “ But that is n't her real name ; that is n't her name on her cards . ” “ It 's a pity you have n't got one of my cards ! ” said Miss Miller . “ Her real name is Annie P. Miller , ” the boy went on . “ Ask him HIS name , ” said his sister , indicating Winterbourne . But on this point Randolph seemed perfectly indifferent ; he continued to supply information with regard to his own family . “ My father 's name is Ezra B. Miller , ” he announced . “ My father ai n't in Europe ; my father 's in a better place than Europe . ” Winterbourne imagined for a moment that this was the manner in which the child had been taught to intimate that Mr. Miller had been removed to the sphere of celestial reward . But Randolph immediately added , “ My father 's in Schenectady . He 's got a big business .

Winterbourne presently released the child , who departed , dragging his alpenstock along the path . “ He does n't like Europe , ” said the young girl . “ He wants to go back . ” “ To Schenectady , you mean ? ” “ Yes ; he wants to go right home . He has n't got any boys here . There is one boy here , but he always goes round with a teacher ; they wo n't let him play . ” “ And your brother has n't any teacher ? ” Winterbourne inquired . “ Mother thought of getting him one , to travel round with us . There was a lady told her of a very good teacher ; an American lady — perhaps you know her — Mrs. Sanders . I think she came from Boston . She told her of this teacher , and we thought of getting him to travel round with us . But Randolph said he did n't want a teacher traveling round with us . He said he would n't have lessons when he was in the cars . And we ARE in the cars about half the time . There was an English lady we met in the cars — I think her name was Miss Featherstone ; perhaps you know her . She wanted to know why I did n't give Randolph lessons — give him ‘ instruction , ’ she called it . I guess he could give me more instruction than I could give him . He 's very smart . ” “ Yes , ” said Winterbourne ; “ he seems very smart . ” “ Mother 's going to get a teacher for him as soon as we get to Italy . Can you get good teachers in Italy ? ” “ Very good , I should think , ” said Winterbourne . “ Or else she 's going to find some school . He ought to learn some more . He 's only nine . He 's going to college . ” And in this way Miss Miller continued to converse upon the affairs of her family and upon other topics . She sat there with her extremely pretty hands , ornamented with very brilliant rings , folded in her lap , and with her pretty eyes now resting upon those of Winterbourne , now wandering over the garden , the people who passed by , and the beautiful view . She talked to Winterbourne as if she had known him a long time . He found it very pleasant . It was many years since he had heard a young girl talk so much . It might have been said of this unknown young lady , who had come and sat down beside him upon a bench , that she chattered . She was very quiet ; she sat in a charming , tranquil attitude ; but her lips and her eyes were constantly moving . She had a soft , slender , agreeable voice , and her tone was decidedly sociable .

Certainly she was very charming , but how deucedly sociable ! Was she simply a pretty girl from New York State ? Were they all like that , the pretty girls who had a good deal of gentlemen 's society ? Or was she also a designing , an audacious , an unscrupulous young person ?

It presently became apparent that he was on the way to learn . “ Have you been to that old castle ? ” asked the young girl , pointing with her parasol to the far-gleaming walls of the Chateau de Chillon . “ Yes , formerly , more than once , ” said Winterbourne . “ You too , I suppose , have seen it ? ” “ No ; we have n't been there . I want to go there dreadfully . Of course I mean to go there . I would n't go away from here without having seen that old castle . ” “ It 's a very pretty excursion , ” said Winterbourne , “ and very easy to make .

He 's only nine . He wants to stay at the hotel . Mother 's afraid to leave him alone , and the courier wo n't stay with him ; so we have n't been to many places . But it will be too bad if we do n't go up there . ” And Miss Miller pointed again at the Chateau de Chillon . “ I should think it might be arranged , ” said Winterbourne . “ Could n't you get some one to stay for the afternoon with Randolph ? ” Miss Miller looked at him a moment , and then , very placidly , “ I wish YOU would stay with him ! ” she said .",

He felt that he had lived at Geneva so long that he had lost a good deal ; he had become dishabituated to the American tone . Never , indeed , since he had grown old enough to appreciate things , had he encountered a young American girl of so pronounced a type as this . Certainly she was very charming , but how deucedly sociable ! Was she simply a pretty girl from New York State ? Were they all like that , the pretty girls who had a good deal of gentlemen 's society ? Or was she also a designing , an audacious , an unscrupulous young person ? Winterbourne had lost his instinct in this matter , and his reason could not help him . Miss Daisy Miller looked extremely innocent . Some people had told him that , after all , American girls were exceedingly innocent ; and others had told him that , after all , they were not . He was inclined to think Miss Daisy Miller was a flirt — a pretty American flirt . He had never , as yet , had any relations with young ladies of this category . He had known , here in Europe , two or three women — persons older than Miss Daisy Miller , and provided , for respectability 's sake , with husbands — who were great coquettes — dangerous , terrible women , with whom one 's relations were liable to take a serious turn . But this young girl was not a coquette in that sense ; she was very unsophisticated ; she was only a pretty American flirt . Winterbourne was almost grateful for having found the formula that applied to Miss Daisy Miller . He leaned back in his seat ; he remarked to himself that she had the most charming nose he had ever seen ; he wondered what were the regular conditions and limitations of one 's intercourse with a pretty American flirt . It presently became apparent that he was on the way to learn . “ Have you been to that old castle ? ” asked the young girl , pointing with her parasol to the far-gleaming walls of the Chateau de Chillon . “ Yes , formerly , more than once , ” said Winterbourne . “ You too , I suppose , have seen it ? ” “ No ; we have n't been there . I want to go there dreadfully . Of course I mean to go there . I would n't go away from here without having seen that old castle . ” “ It 's a very pretty excursion , ” said Winterbourne , “ and very easy to make . You can drive , you know , or you can go by the little steamer . ” “ You can go in the cars , ” said Miss Miller . “ Yes ; you can go in the cars , ” Winterbourne assented . “ Our courier says they take you right up to the castle , ” the young girl continued . “ We were going last week , but my mother gave out . She suffers dreadfully from dyspepsia . She said she could n't go . Randolph would n't go either ; he says he does n't think much of old castles . But I guess we 'll go this week , if we can get Randolph . ” “ Your brother is not interested in ancient monuments ? ” Winterbourne inquired , smiling . “ He says he do n't care much about old castles . He 's only nine . He wants to stay at the hotel . Mother 's afraid to leave him alone , and the courier wo n't stay with him ; so we have n't been to many places . But it will be too bad if we do n't go up there . ” And Miss Miller pointed again at the Chateau de Chillon . “ I should think it might be arranged , ” said Winterbourne . “ Could n't you get some one to stay for the afternoon with Randolph ? ” Miss Miller looked at him a moment , and then , very placidly , “ I wish YOU would stay with him ! ” she said . Winterbourne hesitated a moment . “ I should much rather go to Chillon with you . ” “ With me ? ” asked the young girl with the same placidity . She did n't rise , blushing , as a young girl at Geneva would have done ; and yet Winterbourne , conscious that he had been very bold , thought it possible she was offended . “ With your mother , ” he answered very respectfully . But it seemed that both his audacity and his respect were lost upon Miss Daisy Miller . “ I guess my mother wo n't go , after all , ” she said . “ She do n't like to ride round in the afternoon . But did you really mean what you said just now — that you would like to go up there ? ”",

But it seemed that both his audacity and his respect were lost upon Miss Daisy Miller . “ I guess my mother wo n't go , after all , ” she said . “ She do n't like to ride round in the afternoon . But did you really mean what you said just now — that you would like to go up there ? ” “ Most earnestly , ” Winterbourne declared . “ Then we may arrange it . If mother will stay with Randolph , I guess Eugenio will . ” “ Eugenio ? ” the young man inquired . “ Eugenio 's our courier . He does n't like to stay with Randolph ; he 's the most fastidious man I ever saw . But he 's a splendid courier . I guess he 'll stay at home with Randolph if mother does , and then we can go to the castle . ” Winterbourne reflected for an instant as lucidly as possible — “ we ” could only mean Miss Daisy Miller and himself . This program seemed almost too agreeable for credence ; he felt as if he ought to kiss the young lady 's hand . Possibly he would have done so and quite spoiled the project , but at this moment another person , presumably Eugenio , appeared .

Eugenio 's tone apparently threw , even to Miss Miller 's own apprehension , a slightly ironical light upon the young girl 's situation . She turned to Winterbourne , blushing a little — a very little . “ You wo n't back out ? ” she said . “ I shall not be happy till we go ! ” he protested . “ And you are staying in this hotel ? ” she went on . “ And you are really an American ? ” The courier stood looking at Winterbourne offensively .

Mrs. Costello had not seen him for many years , and she was greatly pleased with him , manifesting her approbation by initiating him into many of the secrets of that social sway which , as she gave him to understand , she exerted in the American capital .

And her picture of the minutely hierarchical constitution of the society of that city , which she presented to him in many different lights , was , to Winterbourne 's imagination , almost oppressively striking .

They treat the courier like a familiar friend — like a gentleman . I should n't wonder if he dines with them . Very likely they have never seen a man with such good manners , such fine clothes , so like a gentleman . He probably corresponds to the young lady 's idea of a count . He sits with them in the garden in the evening . I think he smokes . ” Winterbourne listened with interest to these disclosures ; they helped him to make up his mind about Miss Daisy .

Seen them — heard them — and kept out of their way . ” Mrs. Costello was a widow with a fortune ; a person of much distinction , who frequently intimated that , if she were not so dreadfully liable to sick headaches , she would probably have left a deeper impress upon her time . She had a long , pale face , a high nose , and a great deal of very striking white hair , which she wore in large puffs and rouleaux over the top of her head . She had two sons married in New York and another who was now in Europe . This young man was amusing himself at Hamburg , and , though he was on his travels , was rarely perceived to visit any particular city at the moment selected by his mother for her own appearance there . Her nephew , who had come up to Vevey expressly to see her , was therefore more attentive than those who , as she said , were nearer to her . He had imbibed at Geneva the idea that one must always be attentive to one 's aunt . Mrs. Costello had not seen him for many years , and she was greatly pleased with him , manifesting her approbation by initiating him into many of the secrets of that social sway which , as she gave him to understand , she exerted in the American capital . She admitted that she was very exclusive ; but , if he were acquainted with New York , he would see that one had to be . And her picture of the minutely hierarchical constitution of the society of that city , which she presented to him in many different lights , was , to Winterbourne 's imagination , almost oppressively striking . He immediately perceived , from her tone , that Miss Daisy Miller 's place in the social scale was low . “ I am afraid you do n't approve of them , ” he said . “ They are very common , ” Mrs. Costello declared . “ They are the sort of Americans that one does one 's duty by not — not accepting . ” “ Ah , you do n't accept them ? ” said the young man . “ I can n't , my dear Frederick . I would if I could , but I can n't . ” “ The young girl is very pretty , ” said Winterbourne in a moment . “ Of course she 's pretty . But she is very common . ” “ I see what you mean , of course , ” said Winterbourne after another pause . “ She has that charming look that they all have , ” his aunt resumed . “ I can n't think where they pick it up ; and she dresses in perfection — no , you do n't know how well she dresses . I can n't think where they get their taste . ” “ But , my dear aunt , she is not , after all , a Comanche savage . ” “ She is a young lady , ” said Mrs. Costello , “ who has an intimacy with her mamma 's courier . ” “ An intimacy with the courier ? ” the young man demanded . “ Oh , the mother is just as bad ! They treat the courier like a familiar friend — like a gentleman . I should n't wonder if he dines with them . Very likely they have never seen a man with such good manners , such fine clothes , so like a gentleman . He probably corresponds to the young lady 's idea of a count . He sits with them in the garden in the evening . I think he smokes . ” Winterbourne listened with interest to these disclosures ; they helped him to make up his mind about Miss Daisy . Evidently she was rather wild . “ Well , ” he said , “ I am not a courier , and yet she was very charming to me . ” “ You had better have said at first , ” said Mrs. Costello with dignity , “ that you had made her acquaintance . ” “ We simply met in the garden , and we talked a bit . ” “ Tout bonnement ! And pray what did you say ? ” “ I said I should take the liberty of introducing her to my admirable aunt . ” “ I am much obliged to you . ” “ It was to guarantee my respectability , ” said Winterbourne .",

She was very quiet and very comme il faut ; she wore white puffs ; she spoke to no one , and she never dined at the table d'hote .

Winterbourne was silent a moment . “ She tells me she does , ” he answered at last , not knowing what to say . Miss Daisy Miller stopped and stood looking at him . Her prettiness was still visible in the darkness ; she was opening and closing her enormous fan . “ She does n't want to know me ! ” she said suddenly . “ Why do n't you say so ? You need n't be afraid . I 'm not afraid ! ” And she gave a little laugh . Winterbourne fancied there was a tremor in her voice ; he was touched , shocked , mortified by it . “ My dear young lady , ” he protested , “ she knows no one . It 's her wretched health . ” The young girl walked on a few steps , laughing still . “ You need n't be afraid , ” she repeated . “ Why should she want to know me ? ” Then she paused again ; she was close to the parapet of the garden , and in front of her was the starlit lake . There was a vague sheen upon its surface , and in the distance were dimly seen mountain forms . Daisy Miller looked out upon the mysterious prospect and then she gave another little laugh . “ Gracious ! she IS exclusive ! ” she said . Winterbourne wondered whether she was seriously wounded , and for a moment almost wished that her sense of injury might be such as to make it becoming in him to attempt to reassure and comfort her . He had a pleasant sense that she would be very approachable for consolatory purposes . He felt then , for the instant , quite ready to sacrifice his aunt , conversationally ; to admit that she was a proud , rude woman , and to declare that they need n't mind her . But before he had time to commit himself to this perilous mixture of gallantry and impiety , the young lady , resuming her walk , gave an exclamation in quite another tone . “ Well , here 's Mother !

Her prettiness was still visible in the darkness ; she was opening and closing her enormous fan . “ She does n't want to know me ! ” she said suddenly . “ Why do n't you say so ? You need n't be afraid . I 'm not afraid ! ” And she gave a little laugh . Winterbourne fancied there was a tremor in her voice ; he was touched , shocked , mortified by it . “ My dear young lady , ” he protested , “ she knows no one . It 's her wretched health . ” The young girl walked on a few steps , laughing still . “ You need n't be afraid , ” she repeated . “ Why should she want to know me ? ” Then she paused again ; she was close to the parapet of the garden , and in front of her was the starlit lake . There was a vague sheen upon its surface , and in the distance were dimly seen mountain forms . Daisy Miller looked out upon the mysterious prospect and then she gave another little laugh . “ Gracious ! she IS exclusive ! ” she said . Winterbourne wondered whether she was seriously wounded , and for a moment almost wished that her sense of injury might be such as to make it becoming in him to attempt to reassure and comfort her . He had a pleasant sense that she would be very approachable for consolatory purposes . He felt then , for the instant , quite ready to sacrifice his aunt , conversationally ; to admit that she was a proud , rude woman , and to declare that they need n't mind her . But before he had time to commit himself to this perilous mixture of gallantry and impiety , the young lady , resuming her walk , gave an exclamation in quite another tone . “ Well , here 's Mother !

Suddenly it seemed to pause . “ Are you sure it is your mother ? Can you distinguish her in this thick dusk ? ” Winterbourne asked . “ Well ! ” cried Miss Daisy Miller with a laugh ; “ I guess I know my own mother . And when she has got on my shawl , too ! She is always wearing my things . ” The lady in question , ceasing to advance , hovered vaguely about the spot at which she had checked her steps . “ I am afraid your mother does n't see you , ” said Winterbourne . “ Or perhaps , ” he added , thinking , with Miss Miller , the joke permissible — “ perhaps she feels guilty about your shawl . ”",

Daisy Miller was extremely animated , she was in charming spirits ; but she was apparently not at all excited ; she was not fluttered ; she avoided neither his eyes nor those of anyone else ; she blushed neither when she looked at him nor when she felt that people were looking at her .

He had been a little afraid that she would talk loud , laugh overmuch , and even , perhaps , desire to move about the boat a good deal . But he quite forgot his fears ; he sat smiling , with his eyes upon her face , while , without moving from her place , she delivered herself of a great number of original reflections . It was the most charming garrulity he had ever heard . He had assented to the idea that she was “ common ” ; but was she so , after all , or was he simply getting used to her commonness ? Her conversation was chiefly of what metaphysicians term the objective cast , but every now and then it took a subjective turn .",

But Daisy went on to say that she wished Winterbourne would travel with them and “ go round ” with them ; they might know something , in that case . “ Do n't you want to come and teach Randolph ? ” she asked . Winterbourne said that nothing could possibly please him so much , but that he unfortunately other occupations . “ Other occupations ? I do n't believe it ! ” said Miss Daisy . “ What do you mean ? You are not in business . ” The young man admitted that he was not in business ; but he had engagements which , even within a day or two , would force him to go back to Geneva . “ Oh , bother ! ” she said ; “ I do n't believe it ! ” and she began to talk about something else . But a few moments later , when he was pointing out to her the pretty design of an antique fireplace , she broke out irrelevantly , “ You do n't mean to say you are going back to Geneva ? ” “ It is a melancholy fact that I shall have to return to Geneva tomorrow . ” “ Well , Mr. Winterbourne , ” said Daisy , “ I think you 're horrid ! ” “ Oh , do n't say such dreadful things ! ” said Winterbourne — “ just at the last ! ” “ The last ! ” cried the young girl ; “ I call it the first . I have half a mind to leave you here and go straight back to the hotel alone . ” And for the next ten minutes she did nothing but call him horrid . Poor Winterbourne was fairly bewildered ; no young lady had as yet done him the honor to be so agitated by the announcement of his movements . His companion , after this , ceased to pay any attention to the curiosities of Chillon or the beauties of the lake ; she opened fire upon the mysterious charmer in Geneva whom she appeared to have instantly taken it for granted that he was hurrying back to see . How did Miss Daisy Miller know that there was a charmer in Geneva ? Winterbourne , who denied the existence of such a person , was quite unable to discover , and he was divided between amazement at the rapidity of her induction and amusement at the frankness of her persiflage . She seemed to him , in all this , an extraordinary mixture of innocence and crudity . “ Does she never allow you more than three days at a time ? ” asked Daisy ironically . “ Does n't she give you a vacation in summer ? There 's no one so hard worked but they can get leave to go off somewhere at this season . I suppose , if you stay another day , she 'll come after you in the boat . Do wait over till Friday , and I will go down to the landing to see her arrive ! ” Winterbourne began to think he had been wrong to feel disappointed in the temper in which the young lady had embarked . If he had missed the personal accent , the personal accent was now making its appearance . It sounded very distinctly , at last , in her telling him she would stop “ teasing ” him if he would promise her solemnly to come down to Rome in the winter .",

His aunt had been established there for several weeks , and he had received a couple of letters from her . “ Those people you were so devoted to last summer at Vevey have turned up here , courier and all , ” she wrote . “ They seem to have made several acquaintances , but the courier continues to be the most intime . The young lady , however , is also very intimate with some third-rate Italians , with whom she rackets about in a way that makes much talk . Bring me that pretty novel of Cherbuliez 's — Paule Mere — and do n't come later than the 23rd . ” In the natural course of events , Winterbourne , on arriving in Rome , would presently have ascertained Mrs. Miller 's address at the American banker 's and have gone to pay his compliments to Miss Daisy . “ After what happened at Vevey , I think I may certainly call upon them , ” he said to Mrs. Costello . “ If , after what happens — at Vevey and everywhere — you desire to keep up the acquaintance , you are very welcome . Of course a man may know everyone . Men are welcome to the privilege ! ” “ Pray what is it that happens — here , for instance ? ” Winterbourne demanded . “ The girl goes about alone with her foreigners . As to what happens further , you must apply elsewhere for information . She has picked up half a dozen of the regular Roman fortune hunters , and she takes them about to people 's houses . When she comes to a party she brings with her a gentleman with a good deal of manner and a wonderful mustache . ” “ And where is the mother ? ” “ I have n't the least idea . They are very dreadful people . ” Winterbourne meditated a moment . “ They are very ignorant — very innocent only . Depend upon it they are not bad . ” “ They are hopelessly vulgar , ” said Mrs. Costello . “ Whether or no being hopelessly vulgar is being ‘ bad ’ is a question for the metaphysicians . They are bad enough to dislike , at any rate ; and for this short life that is quite enough . ”",

He had , perhaps , not definitely flattered himself that he had made an ineffaceable impression upon her heart , but he was annoyed at hearing of a state of affairs so little in harmony with an image that had lately flitted in and out of his own meditations ; the image of a very pretty girl looking out of an old Roman window and asking herself urgently when Mr. Winterbourne would arrive . If , however , he determined to wait a little before reminding Miss Miller of his claims to her consideration , he went very soon to call upon two or three other friends . One of these friends was an American lady who had spent several winters at Geneva , where she had placed her children at school .

An instant later his pretty sister crossed the threshold ; and then , after a considerable interval , Mrs. Miller slowly advanced . “ I know you ! ” said Randolph . “ I 'm sure you know a great many things , ” exclaimed Winterbourne , taking him by the hand . “ How is your education coming on ? ” Daisy was exchanging greetings very prettily with her hostess , but when she heard Winterbourne 's voice she quickly turned her head . “ Well , I declare ! ” she said . “ I told you I should come , you know , ” Winterbourne rejoined , smiling . “ Well , I did n't believe it , ” said Miss Daisy . “ I am much obliged to you , ” laughed the young man . “ You might have come to see me ! ” said Daisy . “ I arrived only yesterday . ” “ I do n't believe that ! ” the young girl declared . Winterbourne turned with a protesting smile to her mother , but this lady evaded his glance , and , seating herself , fixed her eyes upon her son . “ We 've got a bigger place than this , ” said Randolph . “ It 's all gold on the walls . ” Mrs. Miller turned uneasily in her chair . “ I told you if I were to bring you , you would say something ! ” she murmured . “ I told YOU ! ” Randolph exclaimed . “ I tell YOU , sir ! ” he added jocosely , giving Winterbourne a thump on the knee . “ It IS bigger , too ! ” Daisy had entered upon a lively conversation with her hostess ; Winterbourne judged it becoming to address a few words to her mother . “ I hope you have been well since we parted at Vevey , ” he said . Mrs. Miller now certainly looked at him — at his chin . “ Not very well , sir , ” she answered . “ She 's got the dyspepsia , ” said Randolph . “ I 've got it too . Father 's got it .

Oh , at Schenectady he stands first ; they think everything of him . He has so much to do , and yet there was nothing he would n't do for me .

You have had time to go to see Mrs. Walker . ” “ I knew Mrs. Walker — ” Winterbourne began to explain . “ I know where you knew her . You knew her at Geneva . She told me so . Well , you knew me at Vevey . That 's just as good . So you ought to have come . ” She asked him no other question than this ; she began to prattle about her own affairs . “ We 've got splendid rooms at the hotel ; Eugenio says they 're the best rooms in Rome . We are going to stay all winter , if we do n't die of the fever ; and I guess we 'll stay then . It 's a great deal nicer than I thought ; I thought it would be fearfully quiet ; I was sure it would be awfully poky . I was sure we should be going round all the time with one of those dreadful old men that explain about the pictures and things . But we only had about a week of that , and now I 'm enjoying myself . I know ever so many people , and they are all so charming . The society 's extremely select . There are all kinds — English , and Germans , and Italians . I think I like the English best . I like their style of conversation . But there are some lovely Americans . I never saw anything so hospitable . There 's something or other every day . There 's not much dancing ; but I must say I never thought dancing was everything . I was always fond of conversation . I guess I shall have plenty at Mrs. Walker 's , her rooms are so small . ” When they had passed the gate of the Pincian Gardens , Miss Miller began to wonder where Mr. Giovanelli might be . “ We had better go straight to that place in front , ” she said , “ where you look at the view . ”",

        "context": "Winterbourne was watching the young girl ; at this question his attention quickened . She stood there , smiling and smoothing her bonnet ribbons ; she glanced at Winterbourne . Then , while she glanced and smiled , she answered , without a shade of hesitation , “ Mr. Giovanelli — the beautiful Giovanelli . ” “ My dear young friend , ” said Mrs. Walker , taking her hand pleadingly , “ do n't walk off to the Pincio at this hour to meet a beautiful Italian . ” “ Well , he speaks English , ” said Mrs. Miller . “ Gracious me ! ” Daisy exclaimed , “ I do n't to do anything improper . There 's an easy way to settle it . ” She continued to glance at Winterbourne . “ The Pincio is only a hundred yards distant ; and if Mr. Winterbourne were as polite as he pretends , he would offer to walk with me ! ” Winterbourne 's politeness hastened to affirm itself , and the young girl gave him gracious leave to accompany her . They passed downstairs before her mother , and at the door Winterbourne perceived Mrs. Miller 's carriage drawn up , with the ornamental courier whose acquaintance he had made at Vevey seated within . “ Goodbye , Eugenio ! ” cried Daisy ; “ I 'm going to take a walk . ” The distance from the Via Gregoriana to the beautiful garden at the other end of the Pincian Hill is , in fact , rapidly traversed . As the day was splendid , however , and the concourse of vehicles , walkers , and loungers numerous , the young Americans found their progress much delayed . This fact was highly agreeable to Winterbourne , in spite of his consciousness of his singular situation . The slow-moving , idly gazing Roman crowd bestowed much attention upon the extremely pretty young foreign lady who was passing through it upon his arm ; and he wondered what on earth had been in Daisy 's mind when she proposed to expose herself , unattended , to its appreciation . His own mission , to her sense , apparently , was to consign her to the hands of Mr. Giovanelli ; but Winterbourne , at once annoyed and gratified , resolved that he would do no such thing . “ Why have n't you been to see me ? ” asked Daisy . “ You can n't get out of that . ” “ I have had the honor of telling you that I have only just stepped out of the train . ” “ You must have stayed in the train a good while after it stopped ! ” cried the young girl with her little laugh . “ I suppose you were asleep . You have had time to go to see Mrs. Walker . ” “ I knew Mrs. Walker — ” Winterbourne began to explain . “ I know where you knew her . You knew her at Geneva . She told me so . Well , you knew me at Vevey . That 's just as good . So you ought to have come . ” She asked him no other question than this ; she began to prattle about her own affairs . “ We 've got splendid rooms at the hotel ; Eugenio says they 're the best rooms in Rome . We are going to stay all winter , if we do n't die of the fever ; and I guess we 'll stay then . It 's a great deal nicer than I thought ; I thought it would be fearfully quiet ; I was sure it would be awfully poky . I was sure we should be going round all the time with one of those dreadful old men that explain about the pictures and things . But we only had about a week of that , and now I 'm enjoying myself . I know ever so many people , and they are all so charming . The society 's extremely select . There are all kinds — English , and Germans , and Italians . I think I like the English best . I like their style of conversation . But there are some lovely Americans . I never saw anything so hospitable . There 's something or other every day . There 's not much dancing ; but I must say I never thought dancing was everything . I was always fond of conversation . I guess I shall have plenty at Mrs. Walker 's , her rooms are so small . ” When they had passed the gate of the Pincian Gardens , Miss Miller began to wonder where Mr. Giovanelli might be . “ We had better go straight to that place in front , ” she said , “ where you look at the view . ”",

He bowed to Winterbourne as well as to the latter 's companion ; he had a brilliant smile , an intelligent eye ; Winterbourne thought him not a bad-looking fellow . But he nevertheless said to Daisy , “ No , he 's not the right one . ” Daisy evidently had a natural talent for performing introductions ; she mentioned the name of each of her companions to the other . She strolled alone with one of them on each side of her ; Mr. Giovanelli , who spoke English very cleverly — Winterbourne afterward learned that he had practiced the idiom upon a great many American heiresses — addressed her a great deal of very polite nonsense ; he was extremely urbane , and the young American , who said nothing , reflected upon that profundity of Italian cleverness which enables people to appear more gracious in proportion as they are more acutely disappointed . Giovanelli , of course , had counted upon something more intimate ; he had not bargained for a party of three . But he kept his temper in a manner which suggested far-stretching intentions . Winterbourne flattered himself that he had taken his measure . “ He is not a gentleman , ” said the young American ; “ he is only a clever imitation of one . He is a music master , or a penny-a-liner , or a third-rate artist . Dn his good looks ! ” Mr. Giovanelli had certainly a very pretty face ; but Winterbourne felt a superior indignation at his own lovely fellow countrywoman 's not knowing the difference between a spurious gentleman and a real one . Giovanelli chattered and jested and made himself wonderfully agreeable . It was true that , if he was an imitation , the imitation was brilliant . “ Nevertheless , ” Winterbourne said to himself , “ a nice girl ought to know ! ” And then he came back to the question whether this was , in fact , a nice girl . Would a nice girl , even allowing for her being a little American flirt , make a rendezvous with a presumably low-lived foreigner ? The rendezvous in this case , indeed , had been in broad daylight and in the most crowded corner of Rome , but was it not impossible to regard the choice of these circumstances as a proof of extreme cynicism ? Singular though it may seem , Winterbourne was vexed that the young girl , in joining her amoroso , should not appear more impatient of his own company , and he was vexed because of his inclination . It was impossible to regard her as a perfectly well-conducted young lady ; she was wanting in a certain indispensable delicacy . It would therefore simplify matters greatly to be able to treat her as the object of one of those sentiments which are called by romancers “ lawless passions . ” That she should seem to wish to get rid of him would help him to think more lightly of her , and to be able to think more lightly of her would make her much less perplexing . But Daisy , on this occasion , continued to present herself as an inscrutable combination of audacity and innocence .",

Giovanelli chattered and jested and made himself wonderfully agreeable . It was true that , if he was an imitation , the imitation was brilliant . “ Nevertheless , ” Winterbourne said to himself , “ a nice girl ought to know ! ” And then he came back to the question whether this was , in fact , a nice girl . Would a nice girl , even allowing for her being a little American flirt , make a rendezvous with a presumably low-lived foreigner ? The rendezvous in this case , indeed , had been in broad daylight and in the most crowded corner of Rome , but was it not impossible to regard the choice of these circumstances as a proof of extreme cynicism ? Singular though it may seem , Winterbourne was vexed that the young girl , in joining her amoroso , should not appear more impatient of his own company , and he was vexed because of his inclination . It was impossible to regard her as a perfectly well-conducted young lady ; she was wanting in a certain indispensable delicacy . It would therefore simplify matters greatly to be able to treat her as the object of one of those sentiments which are called by romancers “ lawless passions . ” That she should seem to wish to get rid of him would help him to think more lightly of her , and to be able to think more lightly of her would make her much less perplexing .

He 's staring at the women in the carriages : did you ever see anything so cool ? ” Winterbourne perceived at some distance a little man standing with folded arms nursing his cane . He had a handsome face , an artfully poised hat , a glass in one eye , and a nosegay in his buttonhole . Winterbourne looked at him a moment and then said , “ Do you mean to speak to that man ? ” “ Do I mean to speak to him ? Why , you do n't suppose I mean to communicate by signs ? ” “ Pray understand , then , ” said Winterbourne , “ that I intend to remain with you . ” Daisy stopped and looked at him , without a sign of troubled consciousness in her face , with nothing but the presence of her charming eyes and her happy dimples . “ Well , she 's a cool one ! ” thought the young man . “ I do n't like the way you say that , ” said Daisy . “ It 's too imperious . ” “ I beg your pardon if I say it wrong . The main point is to give you an idea of my meaning . ” The young girl looked at him more gravely , but with eyes that were prettier than ever . “ I have never allowed a gentleman to dictate to me , or to interfere with anything I do . ” “ I think you have made a mistake , ” said Winterbourne . “ You should sometimes listen to a gentleman — the right one . ” Daisy began to laugh again . “ I do nothing but listen to gentlemen ! ” she exclaimed . “ Tell me if Mr. Giovanelli is the right one ? ” The gentleman with the nosegay in his bosom had now perceived our two friends , and was approaching the young girl with obsequious rapidity . He bowed to Winterbourne as well as to the latter 's companion ; he had a brilliant smile , an intelligent eye ; Winterbourne thought him not a bad-looking fellow . But he nevertheless said to Daisy , “ No , he 's not the right one . ” Daisy evidently had a natural talent for performing introductions ; she mentioned the name of each of her companions to the other . She strolled alone with one of them on each side of her ; Mr. Giovanelli , who spoke English very cleverly — Winterbourne afterward learned that he had practiced the idiom upon a great many American heiresses — addressed her a great deal of very polite nonsense ; he was extremely urbane , and the young American , who said nothing , reflected upon that profundity of Italian cleverness which enables people to appear more gracious in proportion as they are more acutely disappointed . Giovanelli , of course , had counted upon something more intimate ; he had not bargained for a party of three . But he kept his temper in a manner which suggested far-stretching intentions . Winterbourne flattered himself that he had taken his measure . “ He is not a gentleman , ” said the young American ; “ he is only a clever imitation of one . He is a music master , or a penny-a-liner , or a third-rate artist . Dn his good looks ! ” Mr. Giovanelli had certainly a very pretty face ; but Winterbourne felt a superior indignation at his own lovely fellow countrywoman 's not knowing the difference between a spurious gentleman and a real one . Giovanelli chattered and jested and made himself wonderfully agreeable . It was true that , if he was an imitation , the imitation was brilliant . “ Nevertheless , ” Winterbourne said to himself , “ a nice girl ought to know ! ” And then he came back to the question whether this was , in fact , a nice girl . Would a nice girl , even allowing for her being a little American flirt , make a rendezvous with a presumably low-lived foreigner ? The rendezvous in this case , indeed , had been in broad daylight and in the most crowded corner of Rome , but was it not impossible to regard the choice of these circumstances as a proof of extreme cynicism ? Singular though it may seem , Winterbourne was vexed that the young girl , in joining her amoroso , should not appear more impatient of his own company , and he was vexed because of his inclination . It was impossible to regard her as a perfectly well-conducted young lady ; she was wanting in a certain indispensable delicacy . It would therefore simplify matters greatly to be able to treat her as the object of one of those sentiments which are called by romancers “ lawless passions . ” That she should seem to wish to get rid of him would help him to think more lightly of her , and to be able to think more lightly of her would make her much less perplexing . But Daisy , on this occasion , continued to present herself as an inscrutable combination of audacity and innocence .",

It was impossible to regard her as a perfectly well-conducted young lady ; she was wanting in a certain indispensable delicacy . It would therefore simplify matters greatly to be able to treat her as the object of one of those sentiments which are called by romancers “ lawless passions . ” That she should seem to wish to get rid of him would help him to think more lightly of her , and to be able to think more lightly of her would make her much less perplexing .

She immediately achieved the introduction , and declared that she had never in her life seen anything so lovely as Mrs. Walker 's carriage rug . “ I am glad you admire it , ” said this lady , smiling sweetly . “ Will you get in and let me put it over you ? ” “ Oh , no , thank you , ” said Daisy . “ I shall admire it much more as I see you driving round with it . ” “ Do get in and drive with me ! ” said Mrs. Walker . “ That would be charming , but it 's so enchanting just as I am ! ” and Daisy gave a brilliant glance at the gentlemen on either side of her . “ It may be enchanting , dear child , but it is not the custom here , ” urged Mrs. Walker , leaning forward in her victoria , with her hands devoutly clasped . “ Well , it ought to be , then ! ” said Daisy . “ If I did n't walk I should expire . ” “ You should walk with your mother , dear , ” cried the lady from Geneva , losing patience . “ With my mother dear ! ” exclaimed the young girl . Winterbourne saw that she scented interference . “ My mother never walked ten steps in her life . And then , you know , ” she added with a laugh , “ I am more than five years old . ” “ You are old enough to be more reasonable . You are old enough , dear Miss Miller , to be talked about . ” Daisy looked at Mrs. Walker , smiling intensely . “ Talked about ? What do you mean ? ” “ Come into my carriage , and I will tell you . ” Daisy turned her quickened glance again from one of the gentlemen beside her to the other . Mr. Giovanelli was bowing to and fro , rubbing down his gloves and laughing very agreeably ; Winterbourne thought it a most unpleasant scene . “ I do n't think I want to know what you mean , ” said Daisy presently . “ I do n't think I should like it . ” Winterbourne wished that Mrs. Walker would tuck in her carriage rug and drive away , but this lady did not enjoy being defied , as she afterward told him . “ Should you prefer being thought a very reckless girl ? ” she demanded . “ Gracious ! ” exclaimed Daisy . She looked again at Mr. Giovanelli , then she turned to Winterbourne . There was a little pink flush in her cheek ; she was tremendously pretty . “ Does Mr. Winterbourne think , ” she asked slowly , smiling , throwing back her head , and glancing at him from head to foot , “ that , to save my reputation , I ought to get into the carriage ? ”",

It is bordered by a large parapet , near which there are several seats . One of the seats at a distance was occupied by a gentleman and a lady , toward whom Mrs. Walker gave a toss of her head . At the same moment these persons rose and walked toward the parapet . Winterbourne had asked the coachman to stop ; he now descended from the carriage . His companion looked at him a moment in silence ; then , while he raised his hat , she drove majestically away . Winterbourne stood there ; he had turned his eyes toward Daisy and her cavalier . They evidently saw no one ; they were too deeply occupied with each other . When they reached the low garden wall , they stood a moment looking off at the great flat-topped pine clusters of the Villa Borghese ; then Giovanelli seated himself , familiarly , upon the broad ledge of the wall . The western sun in the opposite sky sent out a brilliant shaft through a couple of cloud bars , whereupon Daisy 's companion took her parasol out of her hands and opened it . She came a little nearer , and he held the parasol over her ; then , still holding it , he let it rest upon her shoulder , so that both of their heads were hidden from Winterbourne . This young man lingered a moment , then he began to walk . But he walked — not toward the couple with the parasol ; toward the residence of his aunt , Mrs. Costello . He flattered himself on the following day that there was no smiling among the servants when he , at least , asked for Mrs. Miller at her hotel . This lady and her daughter , however , were not at home ; and on the next day after , repeating his visit , Winterbourne again had the misfortune not to find them . Mrs. Walker 's party took place on the evening of the third day , and , in spite of the frigidity of his last interview with the hostess , Winterbourne was among the guests . Mrs. Walker was one of those American ladies who , while residing abroad , make a point , in their own phrase , of studying European society , and she had on this occasion collected several specimens of her diversely born fellow mortals to serve , as it were , as textbooks . When Winterbourne arrived , Daisy Miller was not there , but in a few moments he saw her mother come in alone , very shyly and ruefully . Mrs. Miller 's hair above her exposed-looking temples was more frizzled than ever . As she approached Mrs. Walker , Winterbourne also drew near . “ You see , I 've come all alone , ” said poor Mrs. Miller . “ I 'm so frightened ; I do n't know what to do . It 's the first time I 've ever been to a party alone , especially in this country . I wanted to bring Randolph or Eugenio , or someone , but Daisy just pushed me off by myself . I ai n't used to going round alone . ” “ And does not your daughter intend to favor us with her society ? ” demanded Mrs. Walker impressively . “ Well , Daisy 's all dressed , ” said Mrs. Miller with that accent of the dispassionate , if not of the philosophic , historian with which she always recorded the current incidents of her daughter 's career . “ She got dressed on purpose before dinner . But she 's got a friend of hers there ; that gentleman — the Italian — that she wanted to bring . They 've got going at the piano ; it seems as if they could n't leave off . Mr. Giovanelli sings splendidly . But I guess they 'll come before very long , ” concluded Mrs. Miller hopefully . “ I 'm sorry she should come in that way , ” said Mrs. Walker . “ Well , I told her that there was no use in her getting dressed before dinner if she was going to wait three hours , ” responded Daisy 's mamma . “ I did n't see the use of her putting on such a dress as that to sit round with Mr. Giovanelli . ” “ This is most horrible ! ” said Mrs. Walker , turning away and addressing herself to Winterbourne . “ Elle s'affiche . It 's her revenge for my having ventured to remonstrate with her . When she comes , I shall not speak to her . ”",

        "context": "The carriage was traversing that part of the Pincian Garden that overhangs the wall of Rome and overlooks the beautiful Villa Borghese . It is bordered by a large parapet , near which there are several seats . One of the seats at a distance was occupied by a gentleman and a lady , toward whom Mrs. Walker gave a toss of her head . At the same moment these persons rose and walked toward the parapet . Winterbourne had asked the coachman to stop ; he now descended from the carriage . His companion looked at him a moment in silence ; then , while he raised his hat , she drove majestically away . Winterbourne stood there ; he had turned his eyes toward Daisy and her cavalier . They evidently saw no one ; they were too deeply occupied with each other . When they reached the low garden wall , they stood a moment looking off at the great flat-topped pine clusters of the Villa Borghese ; then Giovanelli seated himself , familiarly , upon the broad ledge of the wall . The western sun in the opposite sky sent out a brilliant shaft through a couple of cloud bars , whereupon Daisy 's companion took her parasol out of her hands and opened it . She came a little nearer , and he held the parasol over her ; then , still holding it , he let it rest upon her shoulder , so that both of their heads were hidden from Winterbourne . This young man lingered a moment , then he began to walk . But he walked — not toward the couple with the parasol ; toward the residence of his aunt , Mrs. Costello . He flattered himself on the following day that there was no smiling among the servants when he , at least , asked for Mrs. Miller at her hotel . This lady and her daughter , however , were not at home ; and on the next day after , repeating his visit , Winterbourne again had the misfortune not to find them . Mrs. Walker 's party took place on the evening of the third day , and , in spite of the frigidity of his last interview with the hostess , Winterbourne was among the guests . Mrs. Walker was one of those American ladies who , while residing abroad , make a point , in their own phrase , of studying European society , and she had on this occasion collected several specimens of her diversely born fellow mortals to serve , as it were , as textbooks . When Winterbourne arrived , Daisy Miller was not there , but in a few moments he saw her mother come in alone , very shyly and ruefully . Mrs. Miller 's hair above her exposed-looking temples was more frizzled than ever . As she approached Mrs. Walker , Winterbourne also drew near . “ You see , I 've come all alone , ” said poor Mrs. Miller . “ I 'm so frightened ; I do n't know what to do . It 's the first time I 've ever been to a party alone , especially in this country . I wanted to bring Randolph or Eugenio , or someone , but Daisy just pushed me off by myself . I ai n't used to going round alone . ” “ And does not your daughter intend to favor us with her society ? ” demanded Mrs. Walker impressively . “ Well , Daisy 's all dressed , ” said Mrs. Miller with that accent of the dispassionate , if not of the philosophic , historian with which she always recorded the current incidents of her daughter 's career . “ She got dressed on purpose before dinner . But she 's got a friend of hers there ; that gentleman — the Italian — that she wanted to bring . They 've got going at the piano ; it seems as if they could n't leave off . Mr. Giovanelli sings splendidly . But I guess they 'll come before very long , ” concluded Mrs. Miller hopefully . “ I 'm sorry she should come in that way , ” said Mrs. Walker . “ Well , I told her that there was no use in her getting dressed before dinner if she was going to wait three hours , ” responded Daisy 's mamma . “ I did n't see the use of her putting on such a dress as that to sit round with Mr. Giovanelli . ” “ This is most horrible ! ” said Mrs. Walker , turning away and addressing herself to Winterbourne . “ Elle s'affiche . It 's her revenge for my having ventured to remonstrate with her . When she comes , I shall not speak to her . ”",

She rustled forward in radiant loveliness , smiling and chattering , carrying a large bouquet , and attended by Mr. Giovanelli . Everyone stopped talking and turned and looked at her . She came straight to Mrs. Walker . “ I 'm afraid you thought I never was coming , so I sent mother off to tell you . I wanted to make Mr. Giovanelli practice some things before he came ; you know he sings beautifully , and I want you to ask him to sing . This is Mr. Giovanelli ; you know I introduced him to you ; he 's got the most lovely voice , and he knows the most charming set of songs .

This gentleman bore himself gallantly . He smiled and bowed and showed his white teeth ; he curled his mustaches and rolled his eyes and performed all the proper functions of a handsome Italian at an evening party .

I did n't enjoy it ; I preferred walking with you . ” “ We paired off : that was much better , ” said Daisy . “ But did you ever hear anything so cool as Mrs. Walker 's wanting me to get into her carriage and drop poor Mr. Giovanelli , and under the pretext that it was proper ?

The Pincio is not the streets , either ; and I , thank goodness , am not a young lady of this country .

The ladies were rarely at home , but when he found them , the devoted Giovanelli was always present . Very often the brilliant little Roman was in the drawing room with Daisy alone , Mrs. Miller being apparently constantly of the opinion that discretion is the better part of surveillance . Winterbourne noted , at first with surprise , that Daisy on these occasions was never embarrassed or annoyed by his own entrance ; but he very presently began to feel that she had no more surprises for him ; the unexpected in her behavior was the only thing to expect . She showed no displeasure at her tete-a-tete with Giovanelli being interrupted ; she could chatter as freshly and freely with two gentlemen as with one ; there was always , in her conversation , the same odd mixture of audacity and puerility . Winterbourne remarked to himself that if she was seriously interested in Giovanelli , it was very singular that she should not take more trouble to preserve the sanctity of their interviews ; and he liked her the more for her innocent-looking indifference and her apparently inexhaustible good humor . He could hardly have said why , but she seemed to him a girl who would never be jealous . At the risk of exciting a somewhat derisive smile on the reader 's part , I may affirm that with regard to the women who had hitherto interested him , it very often seemed to Winterbourne among the possibilities that , given certain contingencies , he should be afraid — literally afraid — of these ladies ; he had a pleasant sense that he should never be afraid of Daisy Miller . It must be added that this sentiment was not altogether flattering to Daisy ; it was part of his conviction , or rather of his apprehension , that she would prove a very light young person . But she was evidently very much interested in Giovanelli . She looked at him whenever he spoke ; she was perpetually telling him to do this and to do that ; she was constantly “ chaffing ” and abusing him . She appeared completely to have forgotten that Winterbourne had said anything to displease her at Mrs. Walker 's little party . One Sunday afternoon , having gone to St. Peter 's with his aunt , Winterbourne perceived Daisy strolling about the great church in company with the inevitable Giovanelli . Presently he pointed out the young girl and her cavalier to Mrs. Costello . This lady looked at them a moment through her eyeglass , and then she said : “ That 's what makes you so pensive in these days , eh ? ” “ I had not the least idea I was pensive , ” said the young man . “ You are very much preoccupied ; you are thinking of something . ” “ And what is it , ” he asked , “ that you accuse me of thinking of ? ” “ Of that young lady 's — Miss Baker 's , Miss Chandler 's — what 's her name ?— Miss Miller 's intrigue with that little barber 's block . ” “ Do you call it an intrigue , ” Winterbourne asked — “ an affair that goes on with such peculiar publicity ? ” “ That 's their folly , ” said Mrs. Costello ; “ it 's not their merit . ” “ No , ” rejoined Winterbourne , with something of that pensiveness to which his aunt had alluded . “ I do n't believe that there is anything to be called an intrigue . ” “ I have heard a dozen people speak of it ; they say she is quite carried away by him . ” “ They are certainly very intimate , ” said Winterbourne .

This lady looked at them a moment through her eyeglass , and then she said : “ That 's what makes you so pensive in these days , eh ? ” “ I had not the least idea I was pensive , ” said the young man . “ You are very much preoccupied ; you are thinking of something . ” “ And what is it , ” he asked , “ that you accuse me of thinking of ? ” “ Of that young lady 's — Miss Baker 's , Miss Chandler 's — what 's her name ?— Miss Miller 's intrigue with that little barber 's block . ” “ Do you call it an intrigue , ” Winterbourne asked — “ an affair that goes on with such peculiar publicity ? ” “ That 's their folly , ” said Mrs. Costello ; “ it 's not their merit . ” “ No , ” rejoined Winterbourne , with something of that pensiveness to which his aunt had alluded . “ I do n't believe that there is anything to be called an intrigue . ” “ I have heard a dozen people speak of it ; they say she is quite carried away by him . ” “ They are certainly very intimate , ” said Winterbourne .

If she thinks him the finest gentleman in the world , he , on his side , has never found himself in personal contact with such splendor , such opulence , such expensiveness as this young lady 's . And then she must seem to him wonderfully pretty and interesting . I rather doubt that he dreams of marrying her . That must appear to him too impossible a piece of luck . He has nothing but his handsome face to offer , and there is a substantial Mr. Miller in that mysterious land of dollars . Giovanelli knows that he has n't a title to offer .

The girl is delightfully pretty , but I thought I understood from you the other day that she was a young lady du meilleur monde . ” “ So she is ! ” answered Winterbourne ; and having assured himself that his informant had seen Daisy and her companion but five minutes before , he jumped into a cab and went to call on Mrs. Miller . She was at home ; but she apologized to him for receiving him in Daisy 's absence .",

        "context": "Of the observation excited by Daisy 's “ intrigue , ” Winterbourne gathered that day at St. Peter 's sufficient evidence . A dozen of the American colonists in Rome came to talk with Mrs. Costello , who sat on a little portable stool at the base of one of the great pilasters . The vesper service was going forward in splendid chants and organ tones in the adjacent choir , and meanwhile , between Mrs. Costello and her friends , there was a great deal said about poor little Miss Miller 's going really “ too far . ” Winterbourne was not pleased with what he heard , but when , coming out upon the great steps of the church , he saw Daisy , who had emerged before him , get into an open cab with her accomplice and roll away through the cynical streets of Rome , he could not deny to himself that she was going very far indeed . He felt very sorry for her — not exactly that he believed that she had completely lost her head , but because it was painful to hear so much that was pretty , and undefended , and natural assigned to a vulgar place among the categories of disorder . He made an attempt after this to give a hint to Mrs. Miller . He met one day in the Corso a friend , a tourist like himself , who had just come out of the Doria Palace , where he had been walking through the beautiful gallery . His friend talked for a moment about the superb portrait of Innocent X by Velasquez which hangs in one of the cabinets of the palace , and then said , “ And in the same cabinet , by the way , I had the pleasure of contemplating a picture of a different kind — that pretty American girl whom you pointed out to me last week . ” In answer to Winterbourne 's inquiries , his friend narrated that the pretty American girl — prettier than ever — was seated with a companion in the secluded nook in which the great papal portrait was enshrined . “ Who was her companion ? ” asked Winterbourne . “ A little Italian with a bouquet in his buttonhole . The girl is delightfully pretty , but I thought I understood from you the other day that she was a young lady du meilleur monde . ” “ So she is ! ” answered Winterbourne ; and having assured himself that his informant had seen Daisy and her companion but five minutes before , he jumped into a cab and went to call on Mrs. Miller . She was at home ; but she apologized to him for receiving him in Daisy 's absence . “ She 's gone out somewhere with Mr. Giovanelli , ” said Mrs. Miller . “ She 's always going round with Mr. Giovanelli . ” “ I have noticed that they are very intimate , ” Winterbourne observed . “ Oh , it seems as if they could n't live without each other ! ” said Mrs. Miller . “ Well , he 's a real gentleman , anyhow . I keep telling Daisy she 's engaged ! ” “ And what does Daisy say ? ” “ Oh , she says she is n't engaged . But she might as well be ! ” this impartial parent resumed ; “ she goes on as if she was . But I 've made Mr. Giovanelli promise to tell me , if SHE does n't . I should want to write to Mr. Miller about it — should n't you ? ” Winterbourne replied that he certainly should ; and the state of mind of Daisy 's mamma struck him as so unprecedented in the annals of parental vigilance that he gave up as utterly irrelevant the attempt to place her upon her guard . After this Daisy was never at home , and Winterbourne ceased to meet her at the houses of their common acquaintances , because , as he perceived , these shrewd people had quite made up their minds that she was going too far . They ceased to invite her ; and they intimated that they desired to express to observant Europeans the great truth that , though Miss Daisy Miller was a young American lady , her behavior was not representative — was regarded by her compatriots as abnormal . Winterbourne wondered how she felt about all the cold shoulders that were turned toward her , and sometimes it annoyed him to suspect that she did not feel at all . He said to himself that she was too light and childish , too uncultivated and unreasoning , too provincial , to have reflected upon her ostracism , or even to have perceived it . Then at other moments he believed that she carried about in her elegant and irresponsible little organism a defiant , passionate , perfectly observant consciousness of the impression she produced . He asked himself whether Daisy 's defiance came from the consciousness of innocence , or from her being , essentially , a young person of the reckless class . It must be admitted that holding one 's self to a belief in Daisy 's “ innocence ” came to seem to Winterbourne more and more a matter of fine-spun gallantry . As I have already had occasion to relate , he was angry at finding himself reduced to chopping logic about this young lady ; he was vexed at his want of instinctive certitude as to how far her eccentricities were generic , national , and how far they were personal . From either view of them he had somehow missed her , and now it was too late . She was “ carried away ” by Mr. Giovanelli .",

        "context": "Of the observation excited by Daisy 's “ intrigue , ” Winterbourne gathered that day at St. Peter 's sufficient evidence . A dozen of the American colonists in Rome came to talk with Mrs. Costello , who sat on a little portable stool at the base of one of the great pilasters . The vesper service was going forward in splendid chants and organ tones in the adjacent choir , and meanwhile , between Mrs. Costello and her friends , there was a great deal said about poor little Miss Miller 's going really “ too far . ” Winterbourne was not pleased with what he heard , but when , coming out upon the great steps of the church , he saw Daisy , who had emerged before him , get into an open cab with her accomplice and roll away through the cynical streets of Rome , he could not deny to himself that she was going very far indeed . He felt very sorry for her — not exactly that he believed that she had completely lost her head , but because it was painful to hear so much that was pretty , and undefended , and natural assigned to a vulgar place among the categories of disorder . He made an attempt after this to give a hint to Mrs. Miller . He met one day in the Corso a friend , a tourist like himself , who had just come out of the Doria Palace , where he had been walking through the beautiful gallery . His friend talked for a moment about the superb portrait of Innocent X by Velasquez which hangs in one of the cabinets of the palace , and then said , “ And in the same cabinet , by the way , I had the pleasure of contemplating a picture of a different kind — that pretty American girl whom you pointed out to me last week . ” In answer to Winterbourne 's inquiries , his friend narrated that the pretty American girl — prettier than ever — was seated with a companion in the secluded nook in which the great papal portrait was enshrined . “ Who was her companion ? ” asked Winterbourne . “ A little Italian with a bouquet in his buttonhole . The girl is delightfully pretty , but I thought I understood from you the other day that she was a young lady du meilleur monde . ” “ So she is ! ” answered Winterbourne ; and having assured himself that his informant had seen Daisy and her companion but five minutes before , he jumped into a cab and went to call on Mrs. Miller . She was at home ; but she apologized to him for receiving him in Daisy 's absence . “ She 's gone out somewhere with Mr. Giovanelli , ” said Mrs. Miller . “ She 's always going round with Mr. Giovanelli . ” “ I have noticed that they are very intimate , ” Winterbourne observed . “ Oh , it seems as if they could n't live without each other ! ” said Mrs. Miller . “ Well , he 's a real gentleman , anyhow . I keep telling Daisy she 's engaged ! ” “ And what does Daisy say ? ” “ Oh , she says she is n't engaged . But she might as well be ! ” this impartial parent resumed ; “ she goes on as if she was . But I 've made Mr. Giovanelli promise to tell me , if SHE does n't . I should want to write to Mr. Miller about it — should n't you ? ” Winterbourne replied that he certainly should ; and the state of mind of Daisy 's mamma struck him as so unprecedented in the annals of parental vigilance that he gave up as utterly irrelevant the attempt to place her upon her guard . After this Daisy was never at home , and Winterbourne ceased to meet her at the houses of their common acquaintances , because , as he perceived , these shrewd people had quite made up their minds that she was going too far . They ceased to invite her ; and they intimated that they desired to express to observant Europeans the great truth that , though Miss Daisy Miller was a young American lady , her behavior was not representative — was regarded by her compatriots as abnormal . Winterbourne wondered how she felt about all the cold shoulders that were turned toward her , and sometimes it annoyed him to suspect that she did not feel at all . He said to himself that she was too light and childish , too uncultivated and unreasoning , too provincial , to have reflected upon her ostracism , or even to have perceived it . Then at other moments he believed that she carried about in her elegant and irresponsible little organism a defiant , passionate , perfectly observant consciousness of the impression she produced . He asked himself whether Daisy 's defiance came from the consciousness of innocence , or from her being , essentially , a young person of the reckless class . It must be admitted that holding one 's self to a belief in Daisy 's “ innocence ” came to seem to Winterbourne more and more a matter of fine-spun gallantry . As I have already had occasion to relate , he was angry at finding himself reduced to chopping logic about this young lady ; he was vexed at his want of instinctive certitude as to how far her eccentricities were generic , national , and how far they were personal . From either view of them he had somehow missed her , and now it was too late . She was “ carried away ” by Mr. Giovanelli .",

        "context": "After this Daisy was never at home , and Winterbourne ceased to meet her at the houses of their common acquaintances , because , as he perceived , these shrewd people had quite made up their minds that she was going too far . They ceased to invite her ; and they intimated that they desired to express to observant Europeans the great truth that , though Miss Daisy Miller was a young American lady , her behavior was not representative — was regarded by her compatriots as abnormal . Winterbourne wondered how she felt about all the cold shoulders that were turned toward her , and sometimes it annoyed him to suspect that she did not feel at all . He said to himself that she was too light and childish , too uncultivated and unreasoning , too provincial , to have reflected upon her ostracism , or even to have perceived it . Then at other moments he believed that she carried about in her elegant and irresponsible little organism a defiant , passionate , perfectly observant consciousness of the impression she produced . He asked himself whether Daisy 's defiance came from the consciousness of innocence , or from her being , essentially , a young person of the reckless class . It must be admitted that holding one 's self to a belief in Daisy 's “ innocence ” came to seem to Winterbourne more and more a matter of fine-spun gallantry . As I have already had occasion to relate , he was angry at finding himself reduced to chopping logic about this young lady ; he was vexed at his want of instinctive certitude as to how far her eccentricities were generic , national , and how far they were personal . From either view of them he had somehow missed her , and now it was too late . She was “ carried away ” by Mr. Giovanelli . A few days after his brief interview with her mother , he encountered her in that beautiful abode of flowering desolation known as the Palace of the Caesars . The early Roman spring had filled the air with bloom and perfume , and the rugged surface of the Palatine was muffled with tender verdure . Daisy was strolling along the top of one of those great mounds of ruin that are embanked with mossy marble and paved with monumental inscriptions . It seemed to him that Rome had never been so lovely as just then . He stood , looking off at the enchanting harmony of line and color that remotely encircles the city , inhaling the softly humid odors , and feeling the freshness of the year and the antiquity of the place reaffirm themselves in mysterious interfusion . It seemed to him also that Daisy had never looked so pretty , but this had been an observation of his whenever he met her . Giovanelli was at her side , and Giovanelli , too , wore an aspect of even unwonted brilliancy . “ Well , ” said Daisy , “ I should think you would be lonesome ! ” “ Lonesome ? ” asked Winterbourne . “ You are always going round by yourself . Ca n't you get anyone to walk with you ? ” “ I am not so fortunate , ” said Winterbourne , “ as your companion . ” Giovanelli , from the first , had treated Winterbourne with distinguished politeness . He listened with a deferential air to his remarks ; he laughed punctiliously at his pleasantries ; he seemed disposed to testify to his belief that Winterbourne was a superior young man . He carried himself in no degree like a jealous wooer ; he had obviously a great deal of tact ; he had no objection to your expecting a little humility of him . It even seemed to Winterbourne at times that Giovanelli would find a certain mental relief in being able to have a private understanding with him — to say to him , as an intelligent man , that , bless you , HE knew how extraordinary was this young lady , and did n't flatter himself with delusive — or at least TOO delusive — hopes of matrimony and dollars . On this occasion he strolled away from his companion to pluck a sprig of almond blossom , which he carefully arranged in his buttonhole . “ I know why you say that , ” said Daisy , watching Giovanelli . “ Because you think I go round too much with HIM . ” And she nodded at her attendant . “ Every one thinks so — if you care to know , ” said Winterbourne . “ Of course I care to know ! ” Daisy exclaimed seriously . “ But I do n't believe it . They are only pretending to be shocked . They do n't really care a straw what I do . Besides , I do n't go round so much . ”",

He listened with a deferential air to his remarks ; he laughed punctiliously at his pleasantries ; he seemed disposed to testify to his belief that Winterbourne was a superior young man . He carried himself in no degree like a jealous wooer ; he had obviously a great deal of tact ; he had no objection to your expecting a little humility of him . It even seemed to Winterbourne at times that Giovanelli would find a certain mental relief in being able to have a private understanding with him — to say to him , as an intelligent man , that , bless you , HE knew how extraordinary was this young lady , and did n't flatter himself with delusive — or at least TOO delusive — hopes of matrimony and dollars . On this occasion he strolled away from his companion to pluck a sprig of almond blossom , which he carefully arranged in his buttonhole . “ I know why you say that , ” said Daisy , watching Giovanelli . “ Because you think I go round too much with HIM . ” And she nodded at her attendant . “ Every one thinks so — if you care to know , ” said Winterbourne . “ Of course I care to know ! ” Daisy exclaimed seriously . “ But I do n't believe it . They are only pretending to be shocked . They do n't really care a straw what I do . Besides , I do n't go round so much . ” “ I think you will find they do care .

Do you know what that means ? ” Daisy was looking at him intently ; she began to color . “ Do you mean as Mrs. Walker did the other night ? ” “ Exactly ! ” said Winterbourne .

He was silent a moment ; and then , “ Yes , I believe it , ” he said . “ Oh , no , you do n't ! ” she answered . “ Well , then — I am not ! ” The young girl and her cicerone were on their way to the gate of the enclosure , so that Winterbourne , who had but lately entered , presently took leave of them . A week afterward he went to dine at a beautiful villa on the Caelian Hill , and , on arriving , dismissed his hired vehicle . The evening was charming , and he promised himself the satisfaction of walking home beneath the Arch of Constantine and past the vaguely lighted monuments of the Forum . There was a waning moon in the sky , and her radiance was not brilliant , but she was veiled in a thin cloud curtain which seemed to diffuse and equalize it . When , on his return from the villa ( it was eleven o'clock ) , Winterbourne approached the dusky circle of the Colosseum , it recurred to him , as a lover of the picturesque , that the interior , in the pale moonshine , would be well worth a glance . He turned aside and walked to one of the empty arches , near which , as he observed , an open carriage — one of the little Roman streetcabs — was stationed . Then he passed in , among the cavernous shadows of the great structure , and emerged upon the clear and silent arena . The place had never seemed to him more impressive . One-half of the gigantic circus was in deep shade , the other was sleeping in the luminous dusk . As he stood there he began to murmur Byron 's famous lines , out of “ Manfred , ” but before he had finished his quotation he remembered that if nocturnal meditations in the Colosseum are recommended by the poets , they are deprecated by the doctors . The historic atmosphere was there , certainly ; but the historic atmosphere , scientifically considered , was no better than a villainous miasma .

Winterbourne began to laugh . “ And does Randolph believe it ? ” he asked . “ I guess Randolph does n't believe anything , ” said Daisy . Randolph 's skepticism excited Winterbourne to further hilarity , and he observed that Giovanelli was coming back to them .

When , on his return from the villa ( it was eleven o'clock ) , Winterbourne approached the dusky circle of the Colosseum , it recurred to him , as a lover of the picturesque , that the interior , in the pale moonshine , would be well worth a glance . He turned aside and walked to one of the empty arches , near which , as he observed , an open carriage — one of the little Roman streetcabs — was stationed .

One-half of the gigantic circus was in deep shade , the other was sleeping in the luminous dusk .

There was a waning moon in the sky , and her radiance was not brilliant , but she was veiled in a thin cloud curtain which seemed to diffuse and equalize it . When , on his return from the villa ( it was eleven o'clock ) , Winterbourne approached the dusky circle of the Colosseum , it recurred to him , as a lover of the picturesque , that the interior , in the pale moonshine , would be well worth a glance . He turned aside and walked to one of the empty arches , near which , as he observed , an open carriage — one of the little Roman streetcabs — was stationed . Then he passed in , among the cavernous shadows of the great structure , and emerged upon the clear and silent arena . The place had never seemed to him more impressive . One-half of the gigantic circus was in deep shade , the other was sleeping in the luminous dusk . As he stood there he began to murmur Byron 's famous lines , out of “ Manfred , ” but before he had finished his quotation he remembered that if nocturnal meditations in the Colosseum are recommended by the poets , they are deprecated by the doctors . The historic atmosphere was there , certainly ; but the historic atmosphere , scientifically considered , was no better than a villainous miasma .

Presently the sound of the woman 's voice came to him distinctly in the warm night air . “ Well , he looks at us as one of the old lions or tigers may have looked at the Christian martyrs ! ” These were the words he heard , in the familiar accent of Miss Daisy Miller . “ Let us hope he is not very hungry , ” responded the ingenious Giovanelli . “ He will have to take me first ; you will serve for dessert ! ” Winterbourne stopped , with a sort of horror , and , it must be added , with a sort of relief . It was as if a sudden illumination had been flashed upon the ambiguity of Daisy 's behavior , and the riddle had become easy to read . She was a young lady whom a gentleman need no longer be at pains to respect . He stood there , looking at her — looking at her companion and not reflecting that though he saw them vaguely , he himself must have been more brightly visible . He felt angry with himself that he had bothered so much about the right way of regarding Miss Daisy Miller . Then , as he was going to advance again , he checked himself , not from the fear that he was doing her injustice , but from a sense of the danger of appearing unbecomingly exhilarated by this sudden revulsion from cautious criticism . He turned away toward the entrance of the place , but , as he did so , he heard Daisy speak again . “ Why , it was Mr. Winterbourne !

Winterbourne came forward again and went toward the great cross . Daisy had got up ; Giovanelli lifted his hat . Winterbourne had now begun to think simply of the craziness , from a sanitary point of view , of a delicate young girl lounging away the evening in this nest of malaria .

        "context": "Winterbourne stopped , with a sort of horror , and , it must be added , with a sort of relief . It was as if a sudden illumination had been flashed upon the ambiguity of Daisy 's behavior , and the riddle had become easy to read . She was a young lady whom a gentleman need no longer be at pains to respect . He stood there , looking at her — looking at her companion and not reflecting that though he saw them vaguely , he himself must have been more brightly visible . He felt angry with himself that he had bothered so much about the right way of regarding Miss Daisy Miller . Then , as he was going to advance again , he checked himself , not from the fear that he was doing her injustice , but from a sense of the danger of appearing unbecomingly exhilarated by this sudden revulsion from cautious criticism . He turned away toward the entrance of the place , but , as he did so , he heard Daisy speak again . “ Why , it was Mr. Winterbourne ! He saw me , and he cuts me ! ” What a clever little reprobate she was , and how smartly she played at injured innocence ! But he would n't cut her . Winterbourne came forward again and went toward the great cross . Daisy had got up ; Giovanelli lifted his hat . Winterbourne had now begun to think simply of the craziness , from a sanitary point of view , of a delicate young girl lounging away the evening in this nest of malaria . What if she WERE a clever little reprobate ? that was no reason for her dying of the perniciosa . “ How long have you been here ? ” he asked almost brutally . Daisy , lovely in the flattering moonlight , looked at him a moment . Then — “ All the evening , ” she answered , gently . * * * “ I never saw anything so pretty . ” “ I am afraid , ” said Winterbourne , “ that you will not think Roman fever very pretty . This is the way people catch it . I wonder , ” he added , turning to Giovanelli , “ that you , a native Roman , should countenance such a terrible indiscretion . ” “ Ah , ” said the handsome native , “ for myself I am not afraid . ” “ Neither am I — for you ! I am speaking for this young lady . ” Giovanelli lifted his well-shaped eyebrows and showed his brilliant teeth . But he took Winterbourne 's rebuke with docility . “ I told the signorina it was a grave indiscretion , but when was the signorina ever prudent ? ” “ I never was sick , and I do n't mean to be ! ” the signorina declared . “ I do n't look like much , but I 'm healthy ! I was bound to see the Colosseum by moonlight ; I should n't have wanted to go home without that ; and we have had the most beautiful time , have n't we , Mr. Giovanelli ? If there has been any danger , Eugenio can give me some pills . He has got some splendid pills . ” “ I should advise you , ” said Winterbourne , “ to drive home as fast as possible and take one ! ” “ What you say is very wise , ” Giovanelli rejoined . “ I will go and make sure the carriage is at hand . ” And he went forward rapidly . Daisy followed with Winterbourne . He kept looking at her ; she seemed not in the least embarrassed . Winterbourne said nothing ; Daisy chattered about the beauty of the place . “ Well , I HAVE seen the Colosseum by moonlight ! ” she exclaimed . “ That 's one good thing . ” Then , noticing Winterbourne 's silence , she asked him why he did n't speak . He made no answer ; he only began to laugh . They passed under one of the dark archways ; Giovanelli was in front with the carriage . Here Daisy stopped a moment , looking at the young American . “ DID you believe I was engaged , the other day ? ” she asked .",

But he took Winterbourne 's rebuke with docility . “ I told the signorina it was a grave indiscretion , but when was the signorina ever prudent ? ” “ I never was sick , and I do n't mean to be ! ” the signorina declared . “ I do n't look like much , but I 'm healthy !

Daisy followed with Winterbourne . He kept looking at her ; she seemed not in the least embarrassed . Winterbourne said nothing ; Daisy chattered about the beauty of the place . “ Well , I HAVE seen the Colosseum by moonlight ! ” she exclaimed . “ That 's one good thing . ” Then , noticing Winterbourne 's silence , she asked him why he did n't speak .

But Giovanelli hurried her forward . “ Quick ! quick ! ” he said ; “ if we get in by midnight we are quite safe . ”",

A lady told me that he was afraid I was angry with him for taking Daisy round at night . Well , so I am , but I suppose he knows I 'm a lady . I would scorn to scold him .

He looked on the ground a moment , and then he said , “ For myself I had no fear ; and she wanted to go . ” “ That was no reason ! ” Winterbourne declared . The subtle Roman again dropped his eyes . “ If she had lived , I should have got nothing . She would never have married me , I am sure . ” “ She would never have married you ? ” “ For a moment I hoped so . But no . I am sure . ” Winterbourne listened to him : he stood staring at the raw protuberance among the April daisies . When he turned away again , Mr. Giovanelli , with his light , slow step , had retired . Winterbourne almost immediately left Rome ; but the following summer he again met his aunt , Mrs. Costello at Vevey . Mrs. Costello was fond of Vevey . In the interval Winterbourne had often thought of Daisy Miller and her mystifying manners . One day he spoke of her to his aunt — said it was on his conscience that he had done her injustice . “ I am sure I do n't know , ” said Mrs. Costello . “ How did your injustice affect her ? ”",
