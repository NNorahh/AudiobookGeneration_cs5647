He worked with the lamp close to him , and the green shade threw a brilliant light upon his hands , and upon the frame and wheels , and left the rest of the room shadowy . When he looked up , coloured patches swam in his eyes . Being constitutionally of a curious nature , he had removed the works — a quite unnecessary proceeding — with the idea of delaying his departure and perhaps falling into conversation with the stranger . But the stranger stood there , perfectly silent and still . So still , it got on Henfrey 's nerves . He felt alone in the room and looked up , and there , grey and dim , was the bandaged head and huge blue lenses staring fixedly , with a mist of green spots drifting in front of them . It was so uncanny to Henfrey that for a minute they remained staring blankly at one another . Then Henfrey looked down again . Very uncomfortable position ! One would like to say something . Should he remark that the weather was very cold for the time of year ? He looked up as if to take aim with that introductory shot . “ The weather — ” he began . “ Why do n't you finish and go ? ” said the rigid figure , evidently in a state of painfully suppressed rage . “ All you 've got to do is to fix the hour-hand on its axle . You 're simply humbugging — ” “ Certainly , sir — one minute more . I overlooked — ” and Mr. Henfrey finished and went . But he went feeling excessively annoyed . “ Damn it ! ” said Mr. Henfrey to himself , trudging down the village through the thawing snow ; “ a man must do a clock at times , sure-ly . ” And again “ Ca n't a man look at you ?— Ugly ! ” And yet again , “ Seemingly not . If the police was wanting you you could n't be more wropped and bandaged . ” At Gleeson 's corner he saw Hall , who had recently married the stranger 's hostess at the “ Coach and Horses , ” and who now drove the Iping conveyance , when occasional people required it , to Sidderbridge Junction , coming towards him on his return from that place . Hall had evidently been “ stopping a bit ” at Sidderbridge , to judge by his driving . “ ‘ Ow do , Teddy ? ” he said , passing . “ You got a rum un up home ! ” said Teddy .

There were a couple of trunks indeed , such as a rational man might need , but in addition there were a box of books — big , fat books , of which some were just in an incomprehensible handwriting — and a dozen or more crates , boxes , and cases , containing objects packed in straw , as it seemed to Hall , tugging with a casual curiosity at the straw — glass bottles . The stranger , muffled in hat , coat , gloves , and wrapper , came out impatiently to meet Fearenside 's cart , while Hall was having a word or so of gossip preparatory to helping being them in . Out he came , not noticing Fearenside 's dog , who was sniffing in a dilettante spirit at Hall 's legs . “ Come along with those boxes , ” he said . “ I 've been waiting long enough . ” And he came down the steps towards the tail of the cart as if to lay hands on the smaller crate . No sooner had Fearenside 's dog caught sight of him , however , than it began to bristle and growl savagely , and when he rushed down the steps it gave an undecided hop , and then sprang straight at his hand . “ Whup ! ” cried Hall , jumping back , for he was no hero with dogs , and Fearenside howled , “ Lie down ! ” and snatched his whip . They saw the dog 's teeth had slipped the hand , heard a kick , saw the dog execute a flanking jump and get home on the stranger 's leg , and heard the rip of his trousering . Then the finer end of Fearenside 's whip reached his property , and the dog , yelping with dismay , retreated under the wheels of the waggon . It was all the business of a swift half-minute . No one spoke , everyone shouted . The stranger glanced swiftly at his torn glove and at his leg , made as if he would stoop to the latter , then turned and rushed swiftly up the steps into the inn . They heard him go headlong across the passage and up the uncarpeted stairs to his bedroom .",

        "context": "Instead of “ seeing ‘ bout it , ” however , Hall on his return was severely rated by his wife on the length of time he had spent in Sidderbridge , and his mild inquiries were answered snappishly and in a manner not to the point . But the seed of suspicion Teddy had sown germinated in the mind of Mr. Hall in spite of these discouragements . “ You wim ’ do n't know everything , ” said Mr. Hall , resolved to ascertain more about the personality of his guest at the earliest possible opportunity . And after the stranger had gone to bed , which he did about half-past nine , Mr. Hall went very aggressively into the parlour and looked very hard at his wife 's furniture , just to show that the stranger was n't master there , and scrutinised closely and a little contemptuously a sheet of mathematical computations the stranger had left . When retiring for the night he instructed Mrs. Hall to look very closely at the stranger 's luggage when it came next day . “ You mind you own business , Hall , ” said Mrs. Hall , “ and I 'll mind mine . ” She was all the more inclined to snap at Hall because the stranger was undoubtedly an unusually strange sort of stranger , and she was by no means assured about him in her own mind . In the middle of the night she woke up dreaming of huge white heads like turnips , that came trailing after her , at the end of interminable necks , and with vast black eyes . But being a sensible woman , she subdued her terrors and turned over and went to sleep again . So it was that on the twenty-ninth day of February , at the beginning of the thaw , this singular person fell out of infinity into Iping village . Next day his luggage arrived through the slush — and very remarkable luggage it was . There were a couple of trunks indeed , such as a rational man might need , but in addition there were a box of books — big , fat books , of which some were just in an incomprehensible handwriting — and a dozen or more crates , boxes , and cases , containing objects packed in straw , as it seemed to Hall , tugging with a casual curiosity at the straw — glass bottles .

Crate after crate yielded bottles , until all six were empty and the table high with straw ; the only things that came out of these crates besides the bottles were a number of test-tubes and a carefully packed balance .

If the straw makes trouble put it down in the bill . ” And he mumbled at her — words suspiciously like curses . He was so odd , standing there , so aggressive and explosive , bottle in one hand and test-tube in the other , that Mrs. Hall was quite alarmed . But she was a resolute woman . “ In which case , I should like to know , sir , what you consider — ” “ A shilling — put down a shilling . Surely a shilling 's enough ? ” “ So be it , ” said Mrs. Hall , taking up the table-cloth and beginning to spread it over the table . “ If you 're satisfied , of course — ” He turned and sat down , with his coat-collar toward her .",

He was so odd , standing there , so aggressive and explosive , bottle in one hand and test-tube in the other , that Mrs. Hall was quite alarmed . But she was a resolute woman . “ In which case , I should like to know , sir , what you consider — ” “ A shilling — put down a shilling . Surely a shilling 's enough ? ” “ So be it , ” said Mrs. Hall , taking up the table-cloth and beginning to spread it over the table . “ If you 're satisfied , of course — ” He turned and sat down , with his coat-collar toward her . All the afternoon he worked with the door locked and , as Mrs. Hall testifies , for the most part in silence . But once there was a concussion and a sound of bottles ringing together as though the table had been hit , and the smash of a bottle flung violently down , and then a rapid pacing athwart the room . Fearing “ something was the matter , ” she went to the door and listened , not caring to knock . “ I can n't go on , ” he was raving . “ I can n't go on . Three hundred thousand , four hundred thousand ! The huge multitude ! Cheated ! All my life it may take me ! ... Patience ! Patience indeed ! ... Fool ! fool ! ” There was a noise of hobnails on the bricks in the bar , and Mrs. Hall had very reluctantly to leave the rest of his soliloquy . When she returned the room was silent again , save for the faint crepitation of his chair and the occasional clink of a bottle . It was all over ; the stranger had resumed work . When she took in his tea she saw broken glass in the corner of the room under the concave mirror , and a golden stain that had been carelessly wiped . She called attention to it . “ Put it down in the bill , ” snapped her visitor . “ For God 's sake do n't worry me . If there 's damage done , put it down in the bill , ” and he went on ticking a list in the exercise book before him . “ I 'll tell you something , ” said Fearenside , mysteriously . It was late in the afternoon , and they were in the little beer-shop of Iping Hanger . “ Well ? ” said Teddy Henfrey . “ This chap you 're speaking of , what my dog bit . Well — he 's black . Leastways , his legs are . I seed through the tear of his trousers and the tear of his glove . You 'd have expected a sort of pinky to show , would n't you ? Well — there was n't none . Just blackness . I tell you , he 's as black as my hat . ”",

The man was just on the boil , and my question boiled him over . He had been given a prescription , most valuable prescription — what for he would n't say . Was it medical ? ‘ Damn you ! What are you fishing after ? ’ I apologised . Dignified sniff and cough . He resumed . He 'd read it . Five ingredients . Put it down ; turned his head . Draught of air from window lifted the paper . Swish , rustle . He was working in a room with an open fireplace , he said . Saw a flicker , and there was the prescription burning and lifting chimneyward . Rushed towards it just as it whisked up the chimney . So ! Just at that point , to illustrate his story , out came his arm . ” “ Well ? ” “ No hand — just an empty sleeve . Lord ! I thought , that 's a deformity ! Got a cork arm , I suppose , and has taken it off . Then , I thought , there 's something odd in that . What the devil keeps that sleeve up and open , if there 's nothing in it ? There was nothing in it , I tell you . Nothing down it , right down to the joint . I could see right down it to the elbow , and there was a glimmer of light shining through a tear of the cloth . ‘ Good God ! ’ I said . Then he stopped . Stared at me with those black goggles of his , and then at his sleeve . ”",

        "context": "Now it happened that in the early hours of Whit Monday , before Millie was hunted out for the day , Mr. Hall and Mrs. Hall both rose and went noiselessly down into the cellar . Their business there was of a private nature , and had something to do with the specific gravity of their beer . They had hardly entered the cellar when Mrs. Hall found she had forgotten to bring down a bottle of sarsaparilla from their joint-room . As she was the expert and principal operator in this affair , Hall very properly went upstairs for it . On the landing he was surprised to see that the stranger 's door was ajar . He went on into his own room and found the bottle as he had been directed . But returning with the bottle , he noticed that the bolts of the front door had been shot back , that the door was in fact simply on the latch . And with a flash of inspiration he connected this with the stranger 's room upstairs and the suggestions of Mr. Teddy Henfrey . He distinctly remembered holding the candle while Mrs. Hall shot these bolts overnight . At the sight he stopped , gaping , then with the bottle still in his hand went upstairs again . He rapped at the stranger 's door . There was no answer . He rapped again ; then pushed the door wide open and entered . It was as he expected . The bed , the room also , was empty . And what was stranger , even to his heavy intelligence , on the bedroom chair and along the rail of the bed were scattered the garments , the only garments so far as he knew , and the bandages of their guest . His big slouch hat even was cocked jauntily over the bed-post . As Hall stood there he heard his wife 's voice coming out of the depth of the cellar , with that rapid telescoping of the syllables and interrogative cocking up of the final words to a high note , by which the West Sussex villager is wont to indicate a brisk impatience . “ George ! You gart whad a wand ? ” At that he turned and hurried down to her . “ Janny , ” he said , over the rail of the cellar steps , “ ‘ tas the truth what Henfrey sez . ‘ E 's not in uz room , ‘ e e n't . And the front door 's onbolted . ” At first Mrs. Hall did not understand , and as soon as she did she resolved to see the empty room for herself . Hall , still holding the bottle , went first . “ If ‘ e e n't there , ” he said , “ ‘ is close are . And what 's ‘ e doin ’ ‘ ithout ‘ is close , then ? ‘ Tas a most curious business . ” As they came up the cellar steps they both , it was afterwards ascertained , fancied they heard the front door open and shut , but seeing it closed and nothing there , neither said a word to the other about it at the time . Mrs. Hall passed her husband in the passage and ran on first upstairs . Someone sneezed on the staircase . Hall , following six steps behind , thought that he heard her sneeze . She , going on first , was under the impression that Hall was sneezing . She flung open the door and stood regarding the room . “ Of all the curious ! ” she said .",

And the front door 's onbolted . ” At first Mrs. Hall did not understand , and as soon as she did she resolved to see the empty room for herself . Hall , still holding the bottle , went first . “ If ‘ e e n't there , ” he said , “ ‘ is close are . And what 's ‘ e doin ’ ‘ ithout ‘ is close , then ? ‘ Tas a most curious business . ” As they came up the cellar steps they both , it was afterwards ascertained , fancied they heard the front door open and shut , but seeing it closed and nothing there , neither said a word to the other about it at the time . Mrs. Hall passed her husband in the passage and ran on first upstairs . Someone sneezed on the staircase . Hall , following six steps behind , thought that he heard her sneeze . She , going on first , was under the impression that Hall was sneezing . She flung open the door and stood regarding the room . “ Of all the curious ! ” she said . She heard a sniff close behind her head as it seemed , and turning , was surprised to see Hall a dozen feet off on the topmost stair . But in another moment he was beside her . She bent forward and put her hand on the pillow and then under the clothes . “ Cold , ” she said . “ He 's been up this hour or more . ” As she did so , a most extraordinary thing happened . The bed-clothes gathered themselves together , leapt up suddenly into a sort of peak , and then jumped headlong over the bottom rail . It was exactly as if a hand had clutched them in the centre and flung them aside . Immediately after , the stranger 's hat hopped off the bed-post , described a whirling flight in the air through the better part of a circle , and then dashed straight at Mrs. Hall 's face . Then as swiftly came the sponge from the washstand ; and then the chair , flinging the stranger 's coat and trousers carelessly aside , and laughing drily in a voice singularly like the stranger 's , turned itself up with its four legs at Mrs. Hall , seemed to take aim at her for a moment , and charged at her . She screamed and turned , and then the chair legs came gently but firmly against her back and impelled her and Hall out of the room . The door slammed violently and was locked . The chair and bed seemed to be executing a dance of triumph for a moment , and then abruptly everything was still .",

Wodger , of the “ Purple Fawn , ” and Mr. Jaggers , the cobbler , who also sold old second-hand ordinary bicycles , were stretching a string of union-jacks and royal ensigns ( which had originally celebrated the first Victorian Jubilee ) across the road . And inside , in the artificial darkness of the parlour , into which only one thin jet of sunlight penetrated , the stranger , hungry we must suppose , and fearful , hidden in his uncomfortable hot wrappings , pored through his dark glasses upon his paper or chinked his dirty little bottles , and occasionally swore savagely at the boys , audible if invisible , outside the windows . In the corner by the fireplace lay the fragments of half a dozen smashed bottles , and a pungent twang of chlorine tainted the air . So much we know from what was heard at the time and from what was subsequently seen in the room . About noon he suddenly opened his parlour door and stood glaring fixedly at the three or four people in the bar . “ Mrs. Hall , ” he said . Somebody went sheepishly and called for Mrs. Hall . Mrs. Hall appeared after an interval , a little short of breath , but all the fiercer for that . Hall was still out . She had deliberated over this scene , and she came holding a little tray with an unsettled bill upon it . “ Is it your bill you 're wanting , sir ? ” she said . “ Why was n't my breakfast laid ? Why have n't you prepared my meals and answered my bell ? Do you think I live without eating ? ” “ Why is n't my bill paid ? ” said Mrs. Hall . “ That 's what I want to know . ” “ I told you three days ago I was awaiting a remittance — ” “ I told you two days ago I was n't going to await no remittances . You can n't grumble if your breakfast waits a bit , if my bill 's been waiting these five days , can you ? ” The stranger swore briefly but vividly . “ Nar , nar ! ” from the bar . “ And I 'd thank you kindly , sir , if you 'd keep your swearing to yourself , sir , ” said Mrs. Hall . The stranger stood looking more like an angry diving-helmet than ever . It was universally felt in the bar that Mrs. Hall had the better of him . His next words showed as much . “ Look here , my good woman — ” he began . “ Do n't ‘ good woman ’ me , ” said Mrs. Hall . “ I 've told you my remittance has n't come . ”",

        "context": "And inside , in the artificial darkness of the parlour , into which only one thin jet of sunlight penetrated , the stranger , hungry we must suppose , and fearful , hidden in his uncomfortable hot wrappings , pored through his dark glasses upon his paper or chinked his dirty little bottles , and occasionally swore savagely at the boys , audible if invisible , outside the windows . In the corner by the fireplace lay the fragments of half a dozen smashed bottles , and a pungent twang of chlorine tainted the air . So much we know from what was heard at the time and from what was subsequently seen in the room . About noon he suddenly opened his parlour door and stood glaring fixedly at the three or four people in the bar . “ Mrs. Hall , ” he said . Somebody went sheepishly and called for Mrs. Hall . Mrs. Hall appeared after an interval , a little short of breath , but all the fiercer for that . Hall was still out . She had deliberated over this scene , and she came holding a little tray with an unsettled bill upon it . “ Is it your bill you 're wanting , sir ? ” she said . “ Why was n't my breakfast laid ? Why have n't you prepared my meals and answered my bell ? Do you think I live without eating ? ” “ Why is n't my bill paid ? ” said Mrs. Hall . “ That 's what I want to know . ” “ I told you three days ago I was awaiting a remittance — ” “ I told you two days ago I was n't going to await no remittances . You can n't grumble if your breakfast waits a bit , if my bill 's been waiting these five days , can you ? ” The stranger swore briefly but vividly . “ Nar , nar ! ” from the bar . “ And I 'd thank you kindly , sir , if you 'd keep your swearing to yourself , sir , ” said Mrs. Hall . The stranger stood looking more like an angry diving-helmet than ever . It was universally felt in the bar that Mrs. Hall had the better of him . His next words showed as much . “ Look here , my good woman — ” he began . “ Do n't ‘ good woman ’ me , ” said Mrs. Hall . “ I 've told you my remittance has n't come . ” “ Remittance indeed ! ” said Mrs. Hall . “ Still , I daresay in my pocket — ” “ You told me three days ago that you had n't anything but a sovereign 's worth of silver upon you . ” “ Well , I 've found some more — ” “ ‘ Ul-lo ! ” from the bar . “ I wonder where you found it , ” said Mrs. Hall . That seemed to annoy the stranger very much . He stamped his foot . “ What do you mean ? ” he said . “ That I wonder where you found it , ” said Mrs. Hall . “ And before I take any bills or get any breakfasts , or do any such things whatsoever , you got to tell me one or two things I do n't understand , and what nobody do n't understand , and what everybody is very anxious to understand . I want to know what you been doing t'my chair upstairs , and I want to know how ‘ tis your room was empty , and how you got in again . Them as stops in this house comes in by the doors — that 's the rule of the house , and that you did n't do , and what I want to know is how you did come in . And I want to know — ”",

Hall next , Wadgers last . They saw in the dim light the headless figure facing them , with a gnawed crust of bread in one gloved hand and a chunk of cheese in the other . “ That 's him ! ” said Hall . “ What the devil 's this ? ” came in a tone of angry expostulation from above the collar of the figure . “ You 're a damned rum customer , mister , ” said Mr. Jaffers . “ But ‘ ed or no ‘ ed , the warrant says ‘ body , ’ and duty 's duty — ” “ Keep off ! ” said the figure , starting back . Abruptly he whipped down the bread and cheese , and Mr. Hall just grasped the knife on the table in time to save it . Off came the stranger 's left glove and was slapped in Jaffers ’ face . In another moment Jaffers , cutting short some statement concerning a warrant , had gripped him by the handless wrist and caught his invisible throat . He got a sounding kick on the shin that made him shout , but he kept his grip . Hall sent the knife sliding along the table to Wadgers , who acted as goal-keeper for the offensive , so to speak , and then stepped forward as Jaffers and the stranger swayed and staggered towards him , clutching and hitting in . A chair stood in the way , and went aside with a crash as they came down together .",

Off came the stranger 's left glove and was slapped in Jaffers ’ face . In another moment Jaffers , cutting short some statement concerning a warrant , had gripped him by the handless wrist and caught his invisible throat . He got a sounding kick on the shin that made him shout , but he kept his grip . Hall sent the knife sliding along the table to Wadgers , who acted as goal-keeper for the offensive , so to speak , and then stepped forward as Jaffers and the stranger swayed and staggered towards him , clutching and hitting in . A chair stood in the way , and went aside with a crash as they came down together . “ Get the feet , ” said Jaffers between his teeth . Mr. Hall , endeavouring to act on instructions , received a sounding kick in the ribs that disposed of him for a moment , and Mr. Wadgers , seeing the decapitated stranger had rolled over and got the upper side of Jaffers , retreated towards the door , knife in hand , and so collided with Mr. Huxter and the Sidderbridge carter coming to the rescue of law and order . At the same moment down came three or four bottles from the chiffonnier and shot a web of pungency into the air of the room . “ I 'll surrender , ” cried the stranger , though he had Jaffers down , and in another moment he stood up panting , a strange figure , headless and handless — for he had pulled off his right glove now as well as his left . “ It 's no good , ” he said , as if sobbing for breath . It was the strangest thing in the world to hear that voice coming as if out of empty space , but the Sussex peasants are perhaps the most matter-of-fact people under the sun . Jaffers got up also and produced a pair of handcuffs . Then he stared . “ I say ! ” said Jaffers , brought up short by a dim realization of the incongruity of the whole business , “ Darn it ! Ca n't use ‘ em as I can see . ” The stranger ran his arm down his waistcoat , and as if by a miracle the buttons to which his empty sleeve pointed became undone . Then he said something about his shin , and stooped down . He seemed to be fumbling with his shoes and socks . “ Why ! ” said Huxter , suddenly , “ that 's not a man at all . It 's just empty clothes . Look ! You can see down his collar and the linings of his clothes . I could put my arm — ” He extended his hand ; it seemed to meet something in mid-air , and he drew it back with a sharp exclamation . “ I wish you 'd keep your fingers out of my eye , ” said the aerial voice , in a tone of savage expostulation . “ The fact is , I 'm all here — head , hands , legs , and all the rest of it , but it happens I 'm invisible . It 's a confounded nuisance , but I am . That 's no reason why I should be poked to pieces by every stupid bumpkin in Iping , is it ? ” The suit of clothes , now all unbuttoned and hanging loosely upon its unseen supports , stood up , arms akimbo . Several other of the men folks had now entered the room , so that it was closely crowded . “ Invisible , eh ? ” said Huxter , ignoring the stranger 's abuse . “ Who ever heard the likes of that ? ”",

Then he sprang up again and flung off his coat . “ Here , stop that , ” said Jaffers , suddenly realising what was happening . He gripped at the waistcoat ; it struggled , and the shirt slipped out of it and left it limply and empty in his hand . “ Hold him ! ” said Jaffers , loudly . “ Once he gets the things off — ” “ Hold him ! ” cried everyone , and there was a rush at the fluttering white shirt which was now all that was visible of the stranger .

Shut the door ! Do n't let him loose ! I got something ! Here he is ! ” A perfect Babel of noises they made . Everybody , it seemed , was being hit all at once , and Sandy Wadgers , knowing as ever and his wits sharpened by a frightful blow in the nose , reopened the door and led the rout .

His feet , save for socks of irregular open-work , were bare , his big toes were broad , and pricked like the ears of a watchful dog .

So he put the four shoes in a graceful group on the turf and looked at them . And seeing them there among the grass and springing agrimony , it suddenly occurred to him that both pairs were exceedingly ugly to see . He was not at all startled by a voice behind him . “ They 're boots , anyhow , ” said the Voice . “ They are — charity boots , ” said Mr. Thomas Marvel , with his head on one side regarding them distastefully ; “ and which is the ugliest pair in the whole blessed universe , I 'm darned if I know ! ” “ H 'm , ” said the Voice . “ I 've worn worse — in fact , I 've worn none .

        "context": "Haysman 's meadow was gay with a tent , in which Mrs. Bunting and other ladies were preparing tea , while , without , the Sunday-school children ran races and played games under the noisy guidance of the curate and the Misses Cuss and Sackbut . No doubt there was a slight uneasiness in the air , but people for the most part had the sense to conceal whatever imaginative qualms they experienced . On the village green an inclined strong , down which , clinging the while to a pulley-swung handle , one could be hurled violently against a sack at the other end , came in for considerable favour among the adolescent , as also did the swings and the cocoanut shies . There was also promenading , and the steam organ attached to a small roundabout filled the air with a pungent flavour of oil and with equally pungent music . Members of the club , who had attended church in the morning , were splendid in badges of pink and green , and some of the gayer-minded had also adorned their bowler hats with brilliant-coloured favours of ribbon . Old Fletcher , whose conceptions of holiday-making were severe , was visible through the jasmine about his window or through the open door ( whichever way you chose to look ) , poised delicately on a plank supported on two chairs , and whitewashing the ceiling of his front room . About four o'clock a stranger entered the village from the direction of the downs . He was a short , stout person in an extraordinarily shabby top hat , and he appeared to be very much out of breath . His cheeks were alternately limp and tightly puffed . His mottled face was apprehensive , and he moved with a sort of reluctant alacrity . He turned the corner of the church , and directed his way to the “ Coach and Horses . ” Among others old Fletcher remembers seeing him , and indeed the old gentleman was so struck by his peculiar agitation that he inadvertently allowed a quantity of whitewash to run down the brush into the sleeve of his coat while regarding him . This stranger , to the perceptions of the proprietor of the cocoanut shy , appeared to be talking to himself , and Mr. Huxter remarked the same thing . He stopped at the foot of the “ Coach and Horses ” steps , and , according to Mr. Huxter , appeared to undergo a severe internal struggle before he could induce himself to enter the house . Finally he marched up the steps , and was seen by Mr. Huxter to turn to the left and open the door of the parlour . Mr. Huxter heard voices from within the room and from the bar apprising the man of his error . “ That room 's private ! ” said Hall , and the stranger shut the door clumsily and went into the bar . In the course of a few minutes he reappeared , wiping his lips with the back of his hand with an air of quiet satisfaction that somehow impressed Mr. Huxter as assumed . He stood looking about him for some moments , and then Mr. Huxter saw him walk in an oddly furtive manner towards the gates of the yard , upon which the parlour window opened . The stranger , after some hesitation , leant against one of the gate-posts , produced a short clay pipe , and prepared to fill it . His fingers trembled while doing so . He lit it clumsily , and folding his arms began to smoke in a languid attitude , an attitude which his occasional glances up the yard altogether belied . All this Mr. Huxter saw over the canisters of the tobacco window , and the singularity of the man 's behaviour prompted him to maintain his observation . Presently the stranger stood up abruptly and put his pipe in his pocket . Then he vanished into the yard . Forthwith Mr. Huxter , conceiving he was witness of some petty larceny , leapt round his counter and ran out into the road to intercept the thief . As he did so , Mr. Marvel reappeared , his hat askew , a big bundle in a blue table-cloth in one hand , and three books tied together — as it proved afterwards with the Vicar 's braces — in the other . Directly he saw Huxter he gave a sort of gasp , and turning sharply to the left , began to run . “ Stop , thief ! ” cried Huxter , and set off after him . Mr. Huxter 's sensations were vivid but brief . He saw the man just before him and spurting briskly for the church corner and the hill road . He saw the village flags and festivities beyond , and a face or so turned towards him . He bawled , “ Stop ! ” again . He had hardly gone ten strides before his shin was caught in some mysterious fashion , and he was no longer running , but flying with inconceivable rapidity through the air . He saw the ground suddenly close to his face . The world seemed to splash into a million whirling specks of light , and subsequent proceedings interested him no more .",

        "context": "Presently the stranger stood up abruptly and put his pipe in his pocket . Then he vanished into the yard . Forthwith Mr. Huxter , conceiving he was witness of some petty larceny , leapt round his counter and ran out into the road to intercept the thief . As he did so , Mr. Marvel reappeared , his hat askew , a big bundle in a blue table-cloth in one hand , and three books tied together — as it proved afterwards with the Vicar 's braces — in the other . Directly he saw Huxter he gave a sort of gasp , and turning sharply to the left , began to run . “ Stop , thief ! ” cried Huxter , and set off after him . Mr. Huxter 's sensations were vivid but brief . He saw the man just before him and spurting briskly for the church corner and the hill road . He saw the village flags and festivities beyond , and a face or so turned towards him . He bawled , “ Stop ! ” again . He had hardly gone ten strides before his shin was caught in some mysterious fashion , and he was no longer running , but flying with inconceivable rapidity through the air . He saw the ground suddenly close to his face . The world seemed to splash into a million whirling specks of light , and subsequent proceedings interested him no more . Now in order clearly to understand what had happened in the inn , it is necessary to go back to the moment when Mr. Marvel first came into view of Mr. Huxter 's window . At that precise moment Mr. Cuss and Mr. Bunting were in the parlour . They were seriously investigating the strange occurrences of the morning , and were , with Mr. Hall 's permission , making a thorough examination of the Invisible Man 's belongings . Jaffers had partially recovered from his fall and had gone home in the charge of his sympathetic friends . The stranger 's scattered garments had been removed by Mrs. Hall and the room tidied up . And on the table under the window where the stranger had been wont to work , Cuss had hit almost at once on three big books in manuscript labelled “ Diary . ” “ Diary ! ” said Cuss , putting the three books on the table . “ Now , at any rate , we shall learn something . ” The Vicar stood with his hands on the table . “ Diary , ” repeated Cuss , sitting down , putting two volumes to support the third , and opening it . “ H 'm — no name on the fly-leaf . Bother !— cypher . And figures . ” The vicar came round to look over his shoulder . Cuss turned the pages over with a face suddenly disappointed . “ I 'm — dear me ! It 's all cypher , Bunting . ” “ There are no diagrams ? ” asked Mr. Bunting . “ No illustrations throwing light — ” “ See for yourself , ” said Mr. Cuss . “ Some of it 's mathematical and some of it 's Russian or some such language ( to judge by the letters ) , and some of it 's Greek . Now the Greek I thought you — ” “ Of course , ” said Mr. Bunting , taking out and wiping his spectacles and feeling suddenly very uncomfortable — for he had no Greek left in his mind worth talking about ; “ yes — the Greek , of course , may furnish a clue . ” “ I 'll find you a place . ” “ I 'd rather glance through the volumes first , ” said Mr. Bunting , still wiping . “ A general impression first , Cuss , and then , you know , we can go looking for clues . ” He coughed , put on his glasses , arranged them fastidiously , coughed again , and wished something would happen to avert the seemingly inevitable exposure . Then he took the volume Cuss handed him in a leisurely manner . And then something did happen .",

The muttered conversation ceased abruptly , for a moment silence , then the conversation was resumed , in hissing whispers , then a sharp cry of “ No ! no , you do n't ! ” There came a sudden motion and the oversetting of a chair , a brief struggle . Silence again . “ What the dooce ? ” exclaimed Henfrey , sotto voce . “ You — all — right thur ? ” asked Mr. Hall , sharply , again . The Vicar 's voice answered with a curious jerking intonation : “ Quite ri-right .

        "context": "It is unavoidable that at this point the narrative should break off again , for a certain very painful reason that will presently be apparent . While these things were going on in the parlour , and while Mr. Huxter was watching Mr. Marvel smoking his pipe against the gate , not a dozen yards away were Mr. Hall and Teddy Henfrey discussing in a state of cloudy puzzlement the one Iping topic . Suddenly there came a violent thud against the door of the parlour , a sharp cry , and then — silence . “ Hul-lo ! ” said Teddy Henfrey . “ Hul-lo ! ” from the Tap . Mr. Hall took things in slowly but surely . “ That ai n't right , ” he said , and came round from behind the bar towards the parlour door . He and Teddy approached the door together , with intent faces . Their eyes considered . “ Summat wrong , ” said Hall , and Henfrey nodded agreement . Whiffs of an unpleasant chemical odour met them , and there was a muffled sound of conversation , very rapid and subdued . “ You all right thur ? ” asked Hall , rapping . The muttered conversation ceased abruptly , for a moment silence , then the conversation was resumed , in hissing whispers , then a sharp cry of “ No ! no , you do n't ! ” There came a sudden motion and the oversetting of a chair , a brief struggle . Silence again . “ What the dooce ? ” exclaimed Henfrey , sotto voce . “ You — all — right thur ? ” asked Mr. Hall , sharply , again . The Vicar 's voice answered with a curious jerking intonation : “ Quite ri-right . Please do n't — interrupt . ” “ Odd ! ” said Mr. Henfrey . “ Odd ! ” said Mr. Hall . “ Says , ‘ Do n't interrupt , ’ ” said Henfrey . “ I heerd'n , ” said Hall . “ And a sniff , ” said Henfrey . They remained listening . The conversation was rapid and subdued . “ I can n't , ” said Mr. Bunting , his voice rising ; “ I tell you , sir , I will not . ” “ What was that ? ” asked Henfrey . “ Says he wi ’ nart , ” said Hall . “ War n't speaking to us , wuz he ? ” “ Disgraceful ! ” said Mr. Bunting , within . “ ‘ Disgraceful , ’ ” said Mr. Henfrey . “ I heard it — distinct . ” “ Who 's that speaking now ? ” asked Henfrey . “ Mr. Cuss , I s'pose , ” said Hall . “ Can you hear — anything ? ” Silence . The sounds within indistinct and perplexing . “ Sounds like throwing the table-cloth about , ” said Hall . Mrs. Hall appeared behind the bar . Hall made gestures of silence and invitation . This aroused Mrs. Hall 's wifely opposition . “ What yer listenin ’ there for , Hall ? ” she asked . “ Ai n't you nothin ’ better to do — busy day like this ? ” Hall tried to convey everything by grimaces and dumb show , but Mrs. Hall was obdurate . She raised her voice . So Hall and Henfrey , rather crestfallen , tiptoed back to the bar , gesticulating to explain to her .",

When the dusk was gathering and Iping was just beginning to peep timorously forth again upon the shattered wreckage of its Bank Holiday , a short , thick-set man in a shabby silk hat was marching painfully through the twilight behind the beechwoods on the road to Bramblehurst .

His rubicund face expressed consternation and fatigue ; he appeared to be in a spasmodic sort of hurry . He was accompanied by a voice other than his own , and ever and again he winced under the touch of unseen hands . “ If you give me the slip again , ” said the Voice , “ if you attempt to give me the slip again — ” “ Lord ! ” said Mr. Marvel . “ That shoulder 's a mass of bruises as it is . ” “ On my honour , ” said the Voice , “ I will kill you . ” “ I did n't try to give you the slip , ” said Marvel , in a voice that was not far remote from tears . “ I swear I did n't .

As it is , I 've been knocked about — ” “ You 'll get knocked about a great deal more if you do n't mind , ” said the Voice , and Mr. Marvel abruptly became silent . He blew out his cheeks , and his eyes were eloquent of despair . “ It 's bad enough to let these floundering yokels explode my little secret , without your cutting off with my books . It 's lucky for some of them they cut and ran when they did ! Here am I ... No one knew I was invisible ! And now what am I to do ? ” “ What am I to do ? ” asked Marvel , sotto voce . “ It 's all about . It will be in the papers ! Everybody will be looking for me ; everyone on their guard — ” The Voice broke off into vivid curses and ceased . The despair of Mr. Marvel 's face deepened , and his pace slackened . “ Go on ! ” said the Voice . Mr. Marvel 's face assumed a greyish tint between the ruddier patches .",

        "context": "Ten o'clock the next morning found Mr. Marvel , unshaven , dirty , and travel-stained , sitting with the books beside him and his hands deep in his pockets , looking very weary , nervous , and uncomfortable , and inflating his cheeks at infrequent intervals , on the bench outside a little inn on the outskirts of Port Stowe . Beside him were the books , but now they were tied with string . The bundle had been abandoned in the pine-woods beyond Bramblehurst , in accordance with a change in the plans of the Invisible Man . Mr. Marvel sat on the bench , and although no one took the slightest notice of him , his agitation remained at fever heat . His hands would go ever and again to his various pockets with a curious nervous fumbling . When he had been sitting for the best part of an hour , however , an elderly mariner , carrying a newspaper , came out of the inn and sat down beside him . “ Pleasant day , ” said the mariner . Mr. Marvel glanced about him with something very like terror . “ Very , ” he said . “ Just seasonable weather for the time of year , ” said the mariner , taking no denial . “ Quite , ” said Mr. Marvel . The mariner produced a toothpick , and ( saving his regard ) was engrossed thereby for some minutes . His eyes meanwhile were at liberty to examine Mr. Marvel 's dusty figure , and the books beside him . As he had approached Mr. Marvel he had heard a sound like the dropping of coins into a pocket . He was struck by the contrast of Mr. Marvel 's appearance with this suggestion of opulence . Thence his mind wandered back again to a topic that had taken a curiously firm hold of his imagination . “ Books ? ” he said suddenly , noisily finishing with the toothpick . Mr. Marvel started and looked at them . “ Oh , yes , ” he said . “ Yes , they 're books . ” “ There 's some extra-ordinary things in books , ” said the mariner . “ I believe you , ” said Mr. Marvel . “ And some extra-ordinary things out of ‘ em , ” said the mariner . “ True likewise , ” said Mr. Marvel . He eyed his interlocutor , and then glanced about him . “ There 's some extra-ordinary things in newspapers , for example , ” said the mariner . “ There are . ” “ In this newspaper , ” said the mariner . “ Ah ! ” said Mr. Marvel . “ There 's a story , ” said the mariner , fixing Mr. Marvel with an eye that was firm and deliberate ; “ there 's a story about an Invisible Man , for instance . ” Mr. Marvel pulled his mouth askew and scratched his cheek and felt his ears glowing . “ What will they be writing next ? ” he asked faintly . “ Ostria , or America ? ” “ Neither , ” said the mariner . “ Here . ” “ Lord ! ” said Mr. Marvel , starting . “ When I say here , ” said the mariner , to Mr. Marvel 's intense relief , “ I do n't of course mean here in this place , I mean hereabouts . ” “ An Invisible Man ! ” said Mr. Marvel . “ And what 's he been up to ? ” “ Everything , ” said the mariner , controlling Marvel with his eye , and then amplifying , “ every — blessed — thing . ”",

I 'm a jolly good mind — ” “ Come up , ” said a Voice , and Mr. Marvel was suddenly whirled about and started marching off in a curious spasmodic manner . “ You 'd better move on , ” said the mariner . “ Who 's moving on ? ” said Mr. Marvel . He was receding obliquely with a curious hurrying gait , with occasional violent jerks forward . Some way along the road he began a muttered monologue , protests and recriminations . “ Silly devil ! ” said the mariner , legs wide apart , elbows akimbo , watching the receding figure . “ I 'll show you , you silly ass — hoaxing me ! It 's here — on the paper ! ” Mr. Marvel retorted incoherently and , receding , was hidden by a bend in the road , but the mariner still stood magnificent in the midst of the way , until the approach of a butcher 's cart dislodged him . Then he turned himself towards Port Stowe . “ Full of extra-ordinary asses , ” he said softly to himself . “ Just to take me down a bit — that was his silly game — It 's on the paper ! ” And there was another extraordinary thing he was presently to hear , that had happened quite close to him . And that was a vision of a “ fist full of money ” ( no less ) travelling without visible agency , along by the wall at the corner of St. Michael 's Lane . A brother mariner had seen this wonderful sight that very morning . He had snatched at the money forthwith and had been knocked headlong , and when he had got to his feet the butterfly money had vanished . Our mariner was in the mood to believe anything , he declared , but that was a bit too stiff . Afterwards , however , he began to think things over . The story of the flying money was true . And all about that neighbourhood , even from the august London and Country Banking Company , from the tills of shops and inns — doors standing that sunny weather entirely open — money had been quietly and dexterously making off that day in handfuls and rouleaux , floating quietly along by walls and shady places , dodging quickly from the approaching eyes of men . And it had , though no man had traced it , invariably ended its mysterious flight in the pocket of that agitated gentleman in the obsolete silk hat , sitting outside the little inn on the outskirts of Port Stowe .",

Dr. Kemp 's solar lamp was lit , albeit the sky was still bright with the sunset light , and his blinds were up because there was no offence of peering outsiders to require them pulled down .

For a minute perhaps he sat , pen in mouth , admiring the rich golden colour above the crest , and then his attention was attracted by the little figure of a man , inky black , running over the hill-brow towards him . He was a shortish little man , and he wore a high hat , and he was running so fast that his legs verily twinkled . “ Another of those fools , ” said Dr. Kemp . “ Like that ass who ran into me this morning round a corner , with the ‘'Visible Man a-coming , sir ! ’ I can n't imagine what possess people .

        "context": "In the early evening time Dr. Kemp was sitting in his study in the belvedere on the hill overlooking Burdock . It was a pleasant little room , with three windows — north , west , and south — and bookshelves covered with books and scientific publications , and a broad writing-table , and , under the north window , a microscope , glass slips , minute instruments , some cultures , and scattered bottles of reagents . Dr. Kemp 's solar lamp was lit , albeit the sky was still bright with the sunset light , and his blinds were up because there was no offence of peering outsiders to require them pulled down . Dr. Kemp was a tall and slender young man , with flaxen hair and a moustache almost white , and the work he was upon would earn him , he hoped , the fellowship of the Royal Society , so highly did he think of it . And his eye , presently wandering from his work , caught the sunset blazing at the back of the hill that is over against his own . For a minute perhaps he sat , pen in mouth , admiring the rich golden colour above the crest , and then his attention was attracted by the little figure of a man , inky black , running over the hill-brow towards him . He was a shortish little man , and he wore a high hat , and he was running so fast that his legs verily twinkled . “ Another of those fools , ” said Dr. Kemp . “ Like that ass who ran into me this morning round a corner , with the ‘'Visible Man a-coming , sir ! ’ I can n't imagine what possess people . One might think we were in the thirteenth century . ” He got up , went to the window , and stared at the dusky hillside , and the dark little figure tearing down it . “ He seems in a confounded hurry , ” said Dr. Kemp , “ but he does n't seem to be getting on . If his pockets were full of lead , he could n't run heavier . ” “ Spurted , sir , ” said Dr. Kemp . In another moment the higher of the villas that had clambered up the hill from Burdock had occulted the running figure . He was visible again for a moment , and again , and then again , three times between the three detached houses that came next , and then the terrace hid him . “ Asses ! ” said Dr. Kemp , swinging round on his heel and walking back to his writing-table . But those who saw the fugitive nearer , and perceived the abject terror on his perspiring face , being themselves in the open roadway , did not share in the doctor 's contempt . By the man pounded , and as he ran he chinked like a well-filled purse that is tossed to and fro . He looked neither to the right nor the left , but his dilated eyes stared straight downhill to where the lamps were being lit , and the people were crowded in the street . And his ill-shaped mouth fell apart , and a glairy foam lay on his lips , and his breath came hoarse and noisy . All he passed stopped and began staring up the road and down , and interrogating one another with an inkling of discomfort for the reason of his haste . And then presently , far up the hill , a dog playing in the road yelped and ran under a gate , and as they still wondered something — a wind — a pad , pad , pad ,— a sound like a panting breathing , rushed by .",

        "context": "As the barman entered the room he saw Marvel , curiously crumpled up and struggling against the door that led to the yard and kitchen . The door flew open while the barman hesitated , and Marvel was dragged into the kitchen . There was a scream and a clatter of pans . Marvel , head down , and lugging back obstinately , was forced to the kitchen door , and the bolts were drawn . Then the policeman , who had been trying to pass the barman , rushed in , followed by one of the cabmen , gripped the wrist of the invisible hand that collared Marvel , was hit in the face and went reeling back . The door opened , and Marvel made a frantic effort to obtain a lodgment behind it . Then the cabman collared something . “ I got him , ” said the cabman . The barman 's red hands came clawing at the unseen . “ Here he is ! ” said the barman . Mr. Marvel , released , suddenly dropped to the ground and made an attempt to crawl behind the legs of the fighting men . The struggle blundered round the edge of the door . The voice of the Invisible Man was heard for the first time , yelling out sharply , as the policeman trod on his foot . Then he cried out passionately and his fists flew round like flails . The cabman suddenly whooped and doubled up , kicked under the diaphragm . The door into the bar-parlour from the kitchen slammed and covered Mr. Marvel 's retreat . The men in the kitchen found themselves clutching at and struggling with empty air . “ Where 's he gone ? ” cried the man with the beard . “ Out ? ” “ This way , ” said the policeman , stepping into the yard and stopping . A piece of tile whizzed by his head and smashed among the crockery on the kitchen table . “ I 'll show him , ” shouted the man with the black beard , and suddenly a steel barrel shone over the policeman 's shoulder , and five bullets had followed one another into the twilight whence the missile had come . As he fired , the man with the beard moved his hand in a horizontal curve , so that his shots radiated out into the narrow yard like spokes from a wheel . A silence followed . “ Five cartridges , ” said the man with the black beard . “ That 's the best of all . Four aces and a joker . Get a lantern , someone , and come and feel about for his body . ” Dr. Kemp had continued writing in his study until the shots aroused him . Crack , crack , crack , they came one after the other . “ Hullo ! ” said Dr. Kemp , putting his pen into his mouth again and listening . “ Who 's letting off revolvers in Burdock ? What are the asses at now ? ” He went to the south window , threw it up , and leaning out stared down on the network of windows , beaded gas-lamps and shops , with its black interstices of roof and yard that made up the town at night . “ Looks like a crowd down the hill , ” he said , “ by ‘ The Cricketers , ’ ” and remained watching . Thence his eyes wandered over the town to far away where the ships ’ lights shone , and the pier glowed — a little illuminated , facetted pavilion like a gem of yellow light . The moon in its first quarter hung over the westward hill , and the stars were clear and almost tropically bright .",

What are the asses at now ? ” He went to the south window , threw it up , and leaning out stared down on the network of windows , beaded gas-lamps and shops , with its black interstices of roof and yard that made up the town at night . “ Looks like a crowd down the hill , ” he said , “ by ‘ The Cricketers , ’ ” and remained watching . Thence his eyes wandered over the town to far away where the ships ’ lights shone , and the pier glowed — a little illuminated , facetted pavilion like a gem of yellow light .

After five minutes , during which his mind had travelled into a remote speculation of social conditions of the future , and lost itself at last over the time dimension , Dr. Kemp roused himself with a sigh , pulled down the window again , and returned to his writing desk .

The feeling that is called “ eerie ” came upon him . He closed the door of the room , came forward to the dressing-table , and put down his burdens . Suddenly , with a start , he perceived a coiled and blood-stained bandage of linen rag hanging in mid-air , between him and the wash-hand stand . He stared at this in amazement . It was an empty bandage , a bandage properly tied but quite empty . He would have advanced to grasp it , but a touch arrested him , and a voice speaking quite close to him . “ Kemp ! ” said the Voice . “ Eh ? ” said Kemp , with his mouth open . “ Keep your nerve , ” said the Voice . “ I 'm an Invisible Man . ” Kemp made no answer for a space , simply stared at the bandage . “ Invisible Man , ” he said . “ I am an Invisible Man , ” repeated the Voice . The story he had been active to ridicule only that morning rushed through Kemp 's brain . He does not appear to have been either very much frightened or very greatly surprised at the moment . Realisation came later . “ I thought it was all a lie , ” he said . The thought uppermost in his mind was the reiterated arguments of the morning . “ Have you a bandage on ? ” he asked . “ Yes , ” said the Invisible Man . “ Oh ! ” said Kemp , and then roused himself . “ I say ! ” he said . “ But this is nonsense . It 's some trick . ” He stepped forward suddenly , and his hand , extended towards the bandage , met invisible fingers . He recoiled at the touch and his colour changed . “ Keep steady , Kemp , for God 's sake ! I want help badly . Stop ! ” The hand gripped his arm . He struck at it . “ Kemp ! ” cried the Voice . “ Kemp ! Keep steady ! ” and the grip tightened . A frantic desire to free himself took possession of Kemp . The hand of the bandaged arm gripped his shoulder , and he was suddenly tripped and flung backwards upon the bed . He opened his mouth to shout , and the corner of the sheet was thrust between his teeth . The Invisible Man had him down grimly , but his arms were free and he struck and tried to kick savagely .",

He opened his mouth to shout , and the corner of the sheet was thrust between his teeth . The Invisible Man had him down grimly , but his arms were free and he struck and tried to kick savagely . “ Listen to reason , will you ? ” said the Invisible Man , sticking to him in spite of a pounding in the ribs . “ By Heaven ! you 'll madden me in a minute ! “ Lie still , you fool ! ” bawled the Invisible Man in Kemp 's ear . Kemp struggled for another moment and then lay still . “ If you shout , I 'll smash your face , ” said the Invisible Man , relieving his mouth . “ I 'm an Invisible Man . It 's no foolishness , and no magic . I really am an Invisible Man . And I want your help . I do n't want to hurt you , but if you behave like a frantic rustic , I must . Do n't you remember me , Kemp ? Griffin , of University College ? ” “ Let me get up , ” said Kemp . “ I 'll stop where I am .

What has this to do with Griffin ? ” “ I am Griffin . ” Kemp thought . “ It 's horrible , ” he said . “ But what devilry must happen to make a man invisible ? ” “ It 's no devilry .

Kemp , you are a man . Take it steady . Give me some food and drink , and let me sit down here . ” Kemp stared at the bandage as it moved across the room , then saw a basket chair dragged across the floor and come to rest near the bed . It creaked , and the seat was depressed the quarter of an inch or so . He rubbed his eyes and felt his neck again . “ This beats ghosts , ” he said , and laughed stupidly . “ That 's better . Thank Heaven , you 're getting sensible ! ” “ Or silly , ” said Kemp , and knuckled his eyes . “ Give me some whiskey . I 'm near dead . ” “ It did n't feel so . Where are you ? If I get up shall I run into you ? There ! all right . Whiskey ? Here . Where shall I give it to you ? ” The chair creaked and Kemp felt the glass drawn away from him . He let go by an effort ; his instinct was all against it . It came to rest poised twenty inches above the front edge of the seat of the chair . He stared at it in infinite perplexity . “ This is — this must be — hypnotism . You have suggested you are invisible . ” “ Nonsense , ” said the Voice . “ It 's frantic . ” “ Listen to me . ” “ I demonstrated conclusively this morning , ” began Kemp , “ that invisibility — ” “ Never mind what you 've demonstrated !— I 'm starving , ” said the Voice , “ and the night is chilly to a man without clothes . ” “ Food ? ” said Kemp . The tumbler of whiskey tilted itself . “ Yes , ” said the Invisible Man rapping it down . “ Have you a dressing-gown ? ” Kemp made some exclamation in an undertone . He walked to a wardrobe and produced a robe of dingy scarlet . “ This do ? ” he asked . It was taken from him . It hung limp for a moment in mid-air , fluttered weirdly , stood full and decorous buttoning itself , and sat down in his chair . “ Drawers , socks , slippers would be a comfort , ” said the Unseen , curtly . “ And food . ”",

        "context": "He was altogether too excited to sleep . His servants , descending sleepily , discovered him , and were inclined to think that over-study had worked this ill on him . He gave them extraordinary but quite explicit instructions to lay breakfast for two in the belvedere study — and then to confine themselves to the basement and ground-floor . Then he continued to pace the dining-room until the morning 's paper came . That had much to say and little to tell , beyond the confirmation of the evening before , and a very badly written account of another remarkable tale from Port Burdock . This gave Kemp the essence of the happenings at the “ Jolly Cricketers , ” and the name of Marvel . “ He has made me keep with him twenty-four hours , ” Marvel testified . Certain minor facts were added to the Iping story , notably the cutting of the village telegraph-wire . But there was nothing to throw light on the connexion between the Invisible Man and the Tramp ; for Mr. Marvel had supplied no information about the three books , or the money with which he was lined . The incredulous tone had vanished and a shoal of reporters and inquirers were already at work elaborating the matter . Kemp read every scrap of the report and sent his housemaid out to get everyone of the morning papers she could . These also he devoured . “ He is invisible ! ” he said . “ And it reads like rage growing to mania ! The things he may do ! The things he may do ! And he 's upstairs free as the air . What on earth ought I to do ? ” “ For instance , would it be a breach of faith if —? No . ” He went to a little untidy desk in the corner , and began a note . He tore this up half written , and wrote another . He read it over and considered it . Then he took an envelope and addressed it to “ Colonel Adye , Port Burdock . ” The Invisible Man awoke even as Kemp was doing this .

Then he resumed abruptly : “ I remember that morning before the change very vividly . I must have gone up Great Portland Street . I remember the barracks in Albany Street , and the horse soldiers coming out , and at last I found the summit of Primrose Hill . It was a sunny day in January — one of those sunny , frosty days that came before the snow this year . My weary brain tried to formulate the position , to plot out a plan of action . “ I was surprised to find , now that my prize was within my grasp , how inconclusive its attainment seemed . As a matter of fact I was worked out ; the intense stress of nearly four years ’ continuous work left me incapable of any strength of feeling . I was apathetic , and I tried in vain to recover the enthusiasm of my first inquiries , the passion of discovery that had enabled me to compass even the downfall of my father 's grey hairs . Nothing seemed to matter . I saw pretty clearly this was a transient mood , due to overwork and want of sleep , and that either by drugs or rest it would be possible to recover my energies . “ All I could think clearly was that the thing had to be carried through ; the fixed idea still ruled me . And soon , for the money I had was almost exhausted . I looked about me at the hillside , with children playing and girls watching them , and tried to think of all the fantastic advantages an invisible man would have in the world .

You know ? ” “ I know the stuff . ” “ And there was someone rapping at the door . It was my landlord with threats and inquiries , an old Polish Jew in a long grey coat and greasy slippers . I had been tormenting a cat in the night , he was sure — the old woman 's tongue had been busy . He insisted on knowing all about it . The laws in this country against vivisection were very severe — he might be liable . I denied the cat . Then the vibration of the little gas engine could be felt all over the house , he said . That was true , certainly . He edged round me into the room , peering about over his German-silver spectacles , and a sudden dread came into my mind that he might carry away something of my secret . I tried to keep between him and the concentrating apparatus I had arranged , and that only made him more curious . What was I doing ? Why was I always alone and secretive ? Was it legal ? Was it dangerous ? I paid nothing but the usual rent . His had always been a most respectable house — in a disreputable neighbourhood . Suddenly my temper gave way . I told him to get out . He began to protest , to jabber of his right of entry . In a moment I had him by the collar ; something ripped , and he went spinning out into his own passage . I slammed and locked the door and sat down quivering .",

I could not find the matches . I beat my hands on the wall with rage . I turned down the gas again , stepped out of the window on the cistern cover , very softly lowered the sash , and sat down , secure and invisible , but quivering with anger , to watch events . They split a panel , I saw , and in another moment they had broken away the staples of the bolts and stood in the open doorway . It was the landlord and his two step-sons , sturdy young men of three or four and twenty . Behind them fluttered the old hag of a woman from downstairs . “ You may imagine their astonishment to find the room empty . One of the younger men rushed to the window at once , flung it up and stared out . His staring eyes and thick-lipped bearded face came a foot from my face . I was half minded to hit his silly countenance , but I arrested my doubled fist . He stared right through me . So did the others as they joined him . The old man went and peered under the bed , and then they all made a rush for the cupboard . They had to argue about it at length in Yiddish and Cockney English . They concluded I had not answered them , that their imagination had deceived them .

The sons protested in garbled English that I was an electrician , and appealed to the dynamos and radiators . They were all nervous about my arrival , although I found subsequently that they had bolted the front door . The old lady peered into the cupboard and under the bed , and one of the young men pushed up the register and stared up the chimney .

Then I slipped up again with a box of matches , fired my heap of paper and rubbish , put the chairs and bedding thereby , led the gas to the affair , by means of an india-rubber tube , and waving a farewell to the room left it for the last time . ” “ You fired the house ! ” exclaimed Kemp .",

My back had now become very stiff and sore , my tonsils were painful from the cabman 's fingers , and the skin of my neck had been scratched by his nails ; my feet hurt exceedingly and I was lame from a little cut on one foot . I saw in time a blind man approaching me , and fled limping , for I feared his subtle intuitions . Once or twice accidental collisions occurred and I left people amazed , with unaccountable curses ringing in their ears . Then came something silent and quiet against my face , and across the Square fell a thin veil of slowly falling flakes of snow . I had caught a cold , and do as I would I could not avoid an occasional sneeze . And every dog that came in sight , with its pointing nose and curious sniffing , was a terror to me . “ Then came men and boys running , first one and then others , and shouting as they ran . It was a fire . They ran in the direction of my lodging , and looking back down a street I saw a mass of black smoke streaming up above the roofs and telephone wires . It was my lodging burning ; my clothes , my apparatus , all my resources indeed , except my cheque-book and the three volumes of memoranda that awaited me in Great Portland Street , were there . Burning ! I had burnt my boats — if ever a man did ! The place was blazing . ” The Invisible Man paused and thought . Kemp glanced nervously out of the window . “ Yes ? ” he said . “ Go on . ” “ So last January , with the beginning of a snowstorm in the air about me — and if it settled on me it would betray me !— weary , cold , painful , inexpressibly wretched , and still but half convinced of my invisible quality , I began this new life to which I am committed . I had no refuge , no appliances , no human being in the world in whom I could confide . To have told my secret would have given me away — made a mere show and rarity of me .

        "context": "“ This running warmed me to a certain extent , and I went on with a better courage through the maze of less frequented roads that runs hereabouts . My back had now become very stiff and sore , my tonsils were painful from the cabman 's fingers , and the skin of my neck had been scratched by his nails ; my feet hurt exceedingly and I was lame from a little cut on one foot . I saw in time a blind man approaching me , and fled limping , for I feared his subtle intuitions . Once or twice accidental collisions occurred and I left people amazed , with unaccountable curses ringing in their ears . Then came something silent and quiet against my face , and across the Square fell a thin veil of slowly falling flakes of snow . I had caught a cold , and do as I would I could not avoid an occasional sneeze . And every dog that came in sight , with its pointing nose and curious sniffing , was a terror to me . “ Then came men and boys running , first one and then others , and shouting as they ran . It was a fire . They ran in the direction of my lodging , and looking back down a street I saw a mass of black smoke streaming up above the roofs and telephone wires . It was my lodging burning ; my clothes , my apparatus , all my resources indeed , except my cheque-book and the three volumes of memoranda that awaited me in Great Portland Street , were there . Burning ! I had burnt my boats — if ever a man did ! The place was blazing . ” The Invisible Man paused and thought . Kemp glanced nervously out of the window . “ Yes ? ” he said . “ Go on . ” “ So last January , with the beginning of a snowstorm in the air about me — and if it settled on me it would betray me !— weary , cold , painful , inexpressibly wretched , and still but half convinced of my invisible quality , I began this new life to which I am committed . I had no refuge , no appliances , no human being in the world in whom I could confide . To have told my secret would have given me away — made a mere show and rarity of me . Nevertheless , I was half-minded to accost some passer-by and throw myself upon his mercy . But I knew too clearly the terror and brutal cruelty my advances would evoke . I made no plans in the street . My sole object was to get shelter from the snow , to get myself covered and warm ; then I might hope to plan .

I scrambled to my feet , looking about me for some way of escape , and even as I did so the sound of my movement made them aware of me . I suppose they saw merely a figure moving quietly and quickly away . ‘ Who 's that ? ’ cried one , and ‘ Stop , there ! ’ shouted the other . I dashed around a corner and came full tilt — a faceless figure , mind you !— on a lanky lad of fifteen . He yelled and I bowled him over , rushed past him , turned another corner , and by a happy inspiration threw myself behind a counter . In another moment feet went running past and I heard voices shouting , ‘ All hands to the doors ! ’ asking what was ‘ up , ’ and giving one another advice how to catch me . “ Lying on the ground , I felt scared out of my wits . But — odd as it may seem — it did not occur to me at the moment to take off my clothes as I should have done . I had made up my mind , I suppose , to get away in them , and that ruled me . And then down the vista of the counters came a bawling of ‘ Here he is ! ’ “ I sprang to my feet , whipped a chair off the counter , and sent it whirling at the fool who had shouted , turned , came into another round a corner , sent him spinning , and rushed up the stairs . He kept his footing , gave a view hallo , and came up the staircase hot after me . Up the staircase were piled a multitude of those bright-coloured pot things — what are they ? ” “ Art pots , ” suggested Kemp . “ That 's it ! Art pots . Well , I turned at the top step and swung round , plucked one out of a pile and smashed it on his silly head as he came at me . The whole pile of pots went headlong , and I heard shouting and footsteps running from all parts . I made a mad rush for the refreshment place , and there was a man in white like a man cook , who took up the chase . I made one last desperate turn and found myself among lamps and ironmongery . I went behind the counter of this , and waited for my cook , and as he bolted in at the head of the chase , I doubled him up with a lamp . Down he went , and I crouched down behind the counter and began whipping off my clothes as fast as I could . Coat , jacket , trousers , shoes were all right , but a lambswool vest fits a man like a skin . I heard more men coming , my cook was lying quiet on the other side of the counter , stunned or scared speechless , and I had to make another dash for it , like a rabbit hunted out of a wood-pile . “ ‘ This way , policeman ! ’ I heard someone shouting . I found myself in my bedstead storeroom again , and at the end of a wilderness of wardrobes . I rushed among them , went flat , got rid of my vest after infinite wriggling , and stood a free man again , panting and scared , as the policeman and three of the shopmen came round the corner . They made a rush for the vest and pants , and collared the trousers . ‘ He 's dropping his plunder , ’ said one of the young men . ‘ He must be somewhere here . ’",

I had no shelter — no covering — to get clothing was to forego all my advantage , to make myself a strange and terrible thing . I was fasting ; for to eat , to fill myself with unassimilated matter , would be to become grotesquely visible again . ” “ I never thought of that , ” said Kemp . “ Nor had I . And the snow had warned me of other dangers . I could not go abroad in snow — it would settle on me and expose me . Rain , too , would make me a watery outline , a glistening surface of a man — a bubble . And fog — I should be like a fainter bubble in a fog , a surface , a greasy glimmer of humanity . Moreover , as I went abroad — in the London air — I gathered dirt about my ankles , floating smuts and dust upon my skin . I did not know how long it would be before I should become visible from that cause also . But I saw clearly it could not be for long . “ Not in London at any rate . “ I went into the slums towards Great Portland Street , and found myself at the end of the street in which I had lodged . I did not go that way , because of the crowd halfway down it opposite to the still smoking ruins of the house I had fired . My most immediate problem was to get clothing . What to do with my face puzzled me . Then I saw in one of those little miscellaneous shops — news , sweets , toys , stationery , belated Christmas tomfoolery , and so forth — an array of masks and noses .

The shop was old-fashioned and low and dark , and the house rose above it for four storeys , dark and dismal . I peered through the window and , seeing no one within , entered .

My dear Kemp , it 's no good your sitting glaring as though I was a murderer . It had to be done . He had his revolver . If once he saw me he would be able to describe me — ” “ But still , ” said Kemp , “ in England — to-day . And the man was in his own house , and you were — well , robbing . ” “ Robbing ! Confound it ! You 'll call me a thief next ! Surely , Kemp , you 're not fool enough to dance on the old strings . Ca n't you see my position ? ” “ And his too , ” said Kemp . The Invisible Man stood up sharply . “ What do you mean to say ? ” Kemp 's face grew a trifle hard . He was about to speak and checked himself . “ I suppose , after all , ” he said with a sudden change of manner , “ the thing had to be done . You were in a fix . But still — ” “ Of course I was in a fix — an infernal fix . And he made me wild too — hunting me about the house , fooling about with his revolver , locking and unlocking doors . He was simply exasperating . You do n't blame me , do you ? You do n't blame me ? ” “ I never blame anyone , ” said Kemp . “ It 's quite out of fashion . What did you do next ? ” “ I was hungry . Downstairs I found a loaf and some rank cheese — more than sufficient to satisfy my hunger . I took some brandy and water , and then went up past my impromptu bag — he was lying quite still — to the room containing the old clothes . This looked out upon the street , two lace curtains brown with dirt guarding the window . I went and peered out through their interstices . Outside the day was bright — by contrast with the brown shadows of the dismal house in which I found myself , dazzlingly bright . A brisk traffic was going by , fruit carts , a hansom , a four-wheeler with a pile of boxes , a fishmonger 's cart . I turned with spots of colour swimming before my eyes to the shadowy fixtures behind me . My excitement was giving place to a clear apprehension of my position again . The room was full of a faint scent of benzoline , used , I suppose , in cleaning the garments . “ I began a systematic search of the place . I should judge the hunchback had been alone in the house for some time . He was a curious person . Everything that could possibly be of service to me I collected in the clothes storeroom , and then I made a deliberate selection .

Finally I chose a mask of the better type , slightly grotesque but not more so than many human beings , dark glasses , greyish whiskers , and a wig . I could find no underclothing , but that I could buy subsequently , and for the time I swathed myself in calico dominoes and some white cashmere scarfs . I could find no socks , but the hunchback 's boots were rather a loose fit and sufficed . In a desk in the shop were three sovereigns and about thirty shillings ’ worth of silver , and in a locked cupboard I burst in the inner room were eight pounds in gold . I could go forth into the world again , equipped . “ Then came a curious hesitation . Was my appearance really credible ? I tried myself with a little bedroom looking-glass , inspecting myself from every point of view to discover any forgotten chink , but it all seemed sound . I was grotesque to the theatrical pitch , a stage miser , but I was certainly not a physical impossibility . Gathering confidence , I took my looking-glass down into the shop , pulled down the shop blinds , and surveyed myself from every point of view with the help of the cheval glass in the corner . “ I spent some minutes screwing up my courage and then unlocked the shop door and marched out into the street , leaving the little man to get out of his sheet again when he liked . In five minutes a dozen turnings intervened between me and the costumier 's shop . No one appeared to notice me very pointedly . My last difficulty seemed overcome . ” He stopped again . “ And you troubled no more about the hunchback ? ” said Kemp . “ No , ” said the Invisible Man . “ Nor have I heard what became of him . I suppose he untied himself or kicked himself out . The knots were pretty tight . ” He became silent and went to the window and stared out . “ What happened when you went out into the Strand ? ” “ Oh !— disillusionment again . I thought my troubles were over . Practically I thought I had impunity to do whatever I chose , everything — save to give away my secret . So I thought . Whatever I did , whatever the consequences might be , was nothing to me . I had merely to fling aside my garments and vanish . No person could hold me . I could take my money where I found it . I decided to treat myself to a sumptuous feast , and then put up at a good hotel , and accumulate a new outfit of property . I felt amazingly confident ; it 's not particularly pleasant recalling that I was an ass . I went into a place and was already ordering lunch , when it occurred to me that I could not eat unless I exposed my invisible face . I finished ordering the lunch , told the man I should be back in ten minutes , and went out exasperated . I do n't know if you have ever been disappointed in your appetite . ” “ Not quite so badly , ” said Kemp , “ but I can imagine it . ” “ I could have smashed the silly devils . At last , faint with the desire for tasteful food , I went into another place and demanded a private room . ‘ I am disfigured , ’ I said . ‘ Badly . ’ They looked at me curiously , but of course it was not their affair — and so at last I got my lunch . It was not particularly well served , but it sufficed ; and when I had had it , I sat over a cigar , trying to plan my line of action . And outside a snowstorm was beginning .",

And that Invisible Man , Kemp , must now establish a Reign of Terror . Yes ; no doubt it 's startling . But I mean it . A Reign of Terror . He must take some town like your Burdock and terrify and dominate it . He must issue his orders . He can do that in a thousand ways — scraps of paper thrust under doors would suffice . And all who disobey his orders he must kill , and kill all who would defend them . ” “ Humph ! ” said Kemp , no longer listening to Griffin but to the sound of his front door opening and closing . “ It seems to me , Griffin , ” he said , to cover his wandering attention , “ that your confederate would be in a difficult position . ” “ No one would know he was a confederate , ” said the Invisible Man , eagerly . And then suddenly , “ Hush ! What 's that downstairs ? ” “ Nothing , ” said Kemp , and suddenly began to speak loud and fast . “ I do n't agree to this , Griffin , ” he said . “ Understand me , I do n't agree to this . Why dream of playing a game against the race ? How can you hope to gain happiness ? Do n't be a lone wolf . Publish your results ; take the world — take the nation at least — into your confidence . Think what you might do with a million helpers — ” The Invisible Man interrupted — arm extended . “ There are footsteps coming upstairs , ” he said in a low voice . “ Nonsense , ” said Kemp . “ Let me see , ” said the Invisible Man , and advanced , arm extended , to the door . And then things happened very swiftly . Kemp hesitated for a second and then moved to intercept him . The Invisible Man started and stood still . “ Traitor ! ” cried the Voice , and suddenly the dressing-gown opened , and sitting down the Unseen began to disrobe . Kemp made three swift steps to the door , and forthwith the Invisible Man — his legs had vanished — sprang to his feet with a shout . Kemp flung the door open . As it opened , there came a sound of hurrying feet downstairs and voices . With a quick movement Kemp thrust the Invisible Man back , sprang aside , and slammed the door . The key was outside and ready . In another moment Griffin would have been alone in the belvedere study , a prisoner . Save for one little thing . The key had been slipped in hastily that morning . As Kemp slammed the door it fell noisily upon the carpet . Kemp 's face became white . He tried to grip the door handle with both hands . For a moment he stood lugging . Then the door gave six inches . But he got it closed again . The second time it was jerked a foot wide , and the dressing-gown came wedging itself into the opening . His throat was gripped by invisible fingers , and he left his hold on the handle to defend himself . He was forced back , tripped and pitched heavily into the corner of the landing . The empty dressing-gown was flung on the top of him .",

But think of what he may do ! ” Adye drew the air in sharply between his teeth . “ It 's unsportsmanlike . I do n't know . But I 'll have powdered glass got ready . If he goes too far .... ” “ The man 's become inhuman , I tell you , ” said Kemp . “ I am as sure he will establish a reign of terror — so soon as he has got over the emotions of this escape — as I am sure I am talking to you . Our only chance is to be ahead . He has cut himself off from his kind . His blood be upon his own head . ” The Invisible Man seems to have rushed out of Kemp 's house in a state of blind fury . A little child playing near Kemp 's gateway was violently caught up and thrown aside , so that its ankle was broken , and thereafter for some hours the Invisible Man passed out of human perceptions . No one knows where he went nor what he did . But one can imagine him hurrying through the hot June forenoon , up the hill and on to the open downland behind Port Burdock , raging and despairing at his intolerable fate , and sheltering at last , heated and weary , amid the thickets of Hintondean , to piece together again his shattered schemes against his species . That seems to most probable refuge for him , for there it was he re-asserted himself in a grimly tragical manner about two in the afternoon . One wonders what his state of mind may have been during that time , and what plans he devised . No doubt he was almost ecstatically exasperated by Kemp 's treachery , and though we may be able to understand the motives that led to that deceit , we may still imagine and even sympathise a little with the fury the attempted surprise must have occasioned . Perhaps something of the stunned astonishment of his Oxford Street experiences may have returned to him , for he had evidently counted on Kemp 's co-operation in his brutal dream of a terrorised world . At any rate he vanished from human ken about midday , and no living witness can tell what he did until about half-past two . It was a fortunate thing , perhaps , for humanity , but for him it was a fatal inaction .",

        "context": "That afternoon the Invisible Man must have learnt something of the rapid use Kemp had made of his confidences . He must have found houses locked and secured ; he may have loitered about railway stations and prowled about inns , and no doubt he read the proclamations and realised something of the nature of the campaign against him . And as the evening advanced , the fields became dotted here and there with groups of three or four men , and noisy with the yelping of dogs . These men-hunters had particular instructions in the case of an encounter as to the way they should support one another . But he avoided them all . We may understand something of his exasperation , and it could have been none the less because he himself had supplied the information that was being used so remorselessly against him . For that day at least he lost heart ; for nearly twenty-four hours , save when he turned on Wicksteed , he was a hunted man . In the night , he must have eaten and slept ; for in the morning he was himself again , active , powerful , angry , and malignant , prepared for his last great struggle against the world . Kemp read a strange missive , written in pencil on a greasy sheet of paper . “ You have been amazingly energetic and clever , ” this letter ran , “ though what you stand to gain by it I cannot imagine . You are against me . For a whole day you have chased me ; you have tried to rob me of a night 's rest . But I have had food in spite of you , I have slept in spite of you , and the game is only beginning . The game is only beginning . There is nothing for it , but to start the Terror . This announces the first day of the Terror . Port Burdock is no longer under the Queen , tell your Colonel of Police , and the rest of them ; it is under me — the Terror ! This is day one of year one of the new epoch — the Epoch of the Invisible Man . I am Invisible Man the First . To begin with the rule will be easy . The first day there will be one execution for the sake of example — a man named Kemp . Death starts for him to-day . He may lock himself away , hide himself away , get guards about him , put on armour if he likes — Death , the unseen Death , is coming . Let him take precautions ; it will impress my people . Death starts from the pillar box by midday . The letter will fall in as the postman comes along , then off ! The game begins . Death starts . Help him not , my people , lest Death fall upon you also . To-day Kemp is to die . ” Kemp read this letter twice , “ It 's no hoax , ” he said . “ That 's his voice ! And he means it . ” He turned the folded sheet over and saw on the addressed side of it the postmark Hintondean , and the prosaic detail “ 2d . to pay . ” He got up slowly , leaving his lunch unfinished — the letter had come by the one o'clock post — and went into his study . He rang for his housekeeper , and told her to go round the house at once , examine all the fastenings of the windows , and close all the shutters . He closed the shutters of his study himself . From a locked drawer in his bedroom he took a little revolver , examined it carefully , and put it into the pocket of his lounge jacket . He wrote a number of brief notes , one to Colonel Adye , gave them to his servant to take , with explicit instructions as to her way of leaving the house . “ There is no danger , ” he said , and added a mental reservation , “ to you . ” He remained meditative for a space after doing this , and then returned to his cooling lunch .",

Kemp swore again , and as he did so the third window went with a snap like a pistol , hung starred for a moment , and collapsed in jagged , shivering triangles into the room .",

He made the girl speak before he dropped the chain , and the three people blundered into the house in a heap , and Kemp slammed the door again . “ The Invisible Man ! ” said Kemp . “ He has a revolver , with two shots — left . He 's killed Adye . Shot him anyhow . Did n't you see him on the lawn ? He 's lying there . ” “ Who ? ” said one of the policemen . “ Adye , ” said Kemp . “ We came in the back way , ” said the girl . “ What 's that smashing ? ” asked one of the policemen . “ He 's in the kitchen — or will be . He has found an axe — ” Suddenly the house was full of the Invisible Man 's resounding blows on the kitchen door . The girl stared towards the kitchen , shuddered , and retreated into the dining-room . Kemp tried to explain in broken sentences . They heard the kitchen door give . “ This way , ” said Kemp , starting into activity , and bundled the policemen into the dining-room doorway . “ Poker , ” said Kemp , and rushed to the fender . He handed the poker he had carried to the policeman and the dining-room one to the other . He suddenly flung himself backward . “ Whup ! ” said one policeman , ducked , and caught the axe on his poker . The pistol snapped its penultimate shot and ripped a valuable Sidney Cooper . The second policeman brought his poker down on the little weapon , as one might knock down a wasp , and sent it rattling to the floor . At the first clash the girl screamed , stood screaming for a moment by the fireplace , and then ran to open the shutters — possibly with an idea of escaping by the shattered window . The axe receded into the passage , and fell to a position about two feet from the ground . They could hear the Invisible Man breathing . “ Stand away , you two , ” he said . “ I want that man Kemp . ” “ We want you , ” said the first policeman , making a quick step forward and wiping with his poker at the Voice . The Invisible Man must have started back , and he blundered into the umbrella stand . Then , as the policeman staggered with the swing of the blow he had aimed , the Invisible Man countered with the axe , the helmet crumpled like paper , and the blow sent the man spinning to the floor at the head of the kitchen stairs . But the second policeman , aiming behind the axe with his poker , hit something soft that snapped . There was a sharp exclamation of pain and then the axe fell to the ground . The policeman wiped again at vacancy and hit nothing ; he put his foot on the axe , and struck again . Then he stood , poker clubbed , listening intent for the slightest movement .",

But the second policeman , aiming behind the axe with his poker , hit something soft that snapped . There was a sharp exclamation of pain and then the axe fell to the ground . The policeman wiped again at vacancy and hit nothing ; he put his foot on the axe , and struck again . Then he stood , poker clubbed , listening intent for the slightest movement . He heard the dining-room window open , and a quick rush of feet within . His companion rolled over and sat up , with the blood running down between his eye and ear . “ Where is he ? ” asked the man on the floor . “ Do n't know . I 've hit him . He 's standing somewhere in the hall . Unless he 's slipped past you . Doctor Kemp — sir . ” Pause . “ Doctor Kemp , ” cried the policeman again . The second policeman began struggling to his feet . He stood up . Suddenly the faint pad of bare feet on the kitchen stairs could be heard . “ Yap ! ” cried the first policeman , and incontinently flung his poker . It smashed a little gas bracket . He made as if he would pursue the Invisible Man downstairs . Then he thought better of it and stepped into the dining-room . “ Doctor Kemp — ” he began , and stopped short . “ Doctor Kemp 's a hero , ” he said , as his companion looked over his shoulder . The dining-room window was wide open , and neither housemaid nor Kemp was to be seen . The second policeman 's opinion of Kemp was terse and vivid .

He ran with wide strides , and wherever a patch of rough ground intervened , wherever there came a patch of raw flints , or a bit of broken glass shone dazzling , he crossed it and left the bare invisible feet that followed to take what line they would .",

The shutters of the drawing-room window were flung open violently , and the housemaid in her outdoor hat and garments , appeared struggling in a frantic manner to throw up the sash . Suddenly a man appeared beside her , helping her — Dr. Kemp ! In another moment the window was open , and the housemaid was struggling out ; she pitched forward and vanished among the shrubs . Mr. Heelas stood up , exclaiming vaguely and vehemently at all these wonderful things . He saw Kemp stand on the sill , spring from the window , and reappear almost instantaneously running along a path in the shrubbery and stooping as he ran , like a man who evades observation . He vanished behind a laburnum , and appeared again clambering over a fence that abutted on the open down . In a second he had tumbled over and was running at a tremendous pace down the slope towards Mr. Heelas . “ Lord ! ” cried Mr. Heelas , struck with an idea ; “ it 's that Invisible Man brute ! It 's right , after all ! ” With Mr. Heelas to think things like that was to act , and his cook watching him from the top window was amazed to see him come pelting towards the house at a good nine miles an hour . There was a slamming of doors , a ringing of bells , and the voice of Mr. Heelas bellowing like a bull . “ Shut the doors , shut the windows , shut everything !— the Invisible Man is coming ! ” Instantly the house was full of screams and directions , and scurrying feet . He ran himself to shut the French windows that opened on the veranda ; as he did so Kemp 's head and shoulders and knee appeared over the edge of the garden fence . In another moment Kemp had ploughed through the asparagus , and was running across the tennis lawn to the house . “ You can n't come in , ” said Mr. Heelas , shutting the bolts . “ I 'm very sorry if he 's after you , but you can n't come in ! ” Kemp appeared with a face of terror close to the glass , rapping and then shaking frantically at the French window . Then , seeing his efforts were useless , he ran along the veranda , vaulted the end , and went to hammer at the side door . Then he ran round by the side gate to the front of the house , and so into the hill-road . And Mr. Heelas staring from his window — a face of horror — had scarcely witnessed Kemp vanish , ere the asparagus was being trampled this way and that by feet unseen . At that Mr. Heelas fled precipitately upstairs , and the rest of the chase is beyond his purview . But as he passed the staircase window , he heard the side gate slam . Emerging into the hill-road , Kemp naturally took the downward direction , and so it was he came to run in his own person the very race he had watched with such a critical eye from the belvedere study only four days ago . He ran it well , for a man out of training , and though his face was white and wet , his wits were cool to the last . He ran with wide strides , and wherever a patch of rough ground intervened , wherever there came a patch of raw flints , or a bit of broken glass shone dazzling , he crossed it and left the bare invisible feet that followed to take what line they would .",

        "context": "For the first time in his life Kemp discovered that the hill-road was indescribably vast and desolate , and that the beginnings of the town far below at the hill foot were strangely remote . Never had there been a slower or more painful method of progression than running . All the gaunt villas , sleeping in the afternoon sun , looked locked and barred ; no doubt they were locked and barred — by his own orders . But at any rate they might have kept a lookout for an eventuality like this ! The town was rising up now , the sea had dropped out of sight behind it , and people down below were stirring . A tram was just arriving at the hill foot . Beyond that was the police station . Was that footsteps he heard behind him ? Spurt . The people below were staring at him , one or two were running , and his breath was beginning to saw in his throat . The tram was quite near now , and the “ Jolly Cricketers ” was noisily barring its doors . Beyond the tram were posts and heaps of gravel — the drainage works . He had a transitory idea of jumping into the tram and slamming the doors , and then he resolved to go for the police station . In another moment he had passed the door of the “ Jolly Cricketers , ” and was in the blistering fag end of the street , with human beings about him . The tram driver and his helper — arrested by the sight of his furious haste — stood staring with the tram horses unhitched . Further on the astonished features of navvies appeared above the mounds of gravel . His pace broke a little , and then he heard the swift pad of his pursuer , and leapt forward again . “ The Invisible Man ! ” he cried to the navvies , with a vague indicative gesture , and by an inspiration leapt the excavation and placed a burly group between him and the chase . Then abandoning the idea of the police station he turned into a little side street , rushed by a greengrocer 's cart , hesitated for the tenth of a second at the door of a sweetstuff shop , and then made for the mouth of an alley that ran back into the main Hill Street again . Two or three little children were playing here , and shrieked and scattered at his apparition , and forthwith doors and windows opened and excited mothers revealed their hearts . Out he shot into Hill Street again , three hundred yards from the tram-line end , and immediately he became aware of a tumultuous vociferation and running people . He glanced up the street towards the hill . Hardly a dozen yards off ran a huge navvy , cursing in fragments and slashing viciously with a spade , and hard behind him came the tram conductor with his fists clenched . Up the street others followed these two , striking and shouting . Down towards the town , men and women were running , and he noticed clearly one man coming out of a shop-door with a stick in his hand . “ Spread out ! Spread out ! ” cried some one . Kemp suddenly grasped the altered condition of the chase . He stopped , and looked round , panting . “ He 's close here ! ” he cried . “ Form a line across — ” He was hit hard under the ear , and went reeling , trying to face round towards his unseen antagonist . He just managed to keep his feet , and he struck a vain counter in the air . Then he was hit again under the jaw , and sprawled headlong on the ground . In another moment a knee compressed his diaphragm , and a couple of eager hands gripped his throat , but the grip of one was weaker than the other ; he grasped the wrists , heard a cry of pain from his assailant , and then the spade of the navvy came whirling through the air above him , and struck something with a dull thud . He felt a drop of moisture on his face . The grip at his throat suddenly relaxed , and with a convulsive effort , Kemp loosed himself , grasped a limp shoulder , and rolled uppermost . He gripped the unseen elbows near the ground . “ I 've got him ! ” screamed Kemp . “ Help ! Help — hold ! He 's down ! Hold his feet ! ”",

Hardly a dozen yards off ran a huge navvy , cursing in fragments and slashing viciously with a spade , and hard behind him came the tram conductor with his fists clenched . Up the street others followed these two , striking and shouting . Down towards the town , men and women were running , and he noticed clearly one man coming out of a shop-door with a stick in his hand . “ Spread out ! Spread out ! ” cried some one . Kemp suddenly grasped the altered condition of the chase . He stopped , and looked round , panting . “ He 's close here ! ” he cried . “ Form a line across — ” He was hit hard under the ear , and went reeling , trying to face round towards his unseen antagonist . He just managed to keep his feet , and he struck a vain counter in the air . Then he was hit again under the jaw , and sprawled headlong on the ground . In another moment a knee compressed his diaphragm , and a couple of eager hands gripped his throat , but the grip of one was weaker than the other ; he grasped the wrists , heard a cry of pain from his assailant , and then the spade of the navvy came whirling through the air above him , and struck something with a dull thud . He felt a drop of moisture on his face . The grip at his throat suddenly relaxed , and with a convulsive effort , Kemp loosed himself , grasped a limp shoulder , and rolled uppermost . He gripped the unseen elbows near the ground . “ I 've got him ! ” screamed Kemp . “ Help ! Help — hold ! He 's down ! Hold his feet ! ” In another second there was a simultaneous rush upon the struggle , and a stranger coming into the road suddenly might have thought an exceptionally savage game of Rugby football was in progress . And there was no shouting after Kemp 's cry — only a sound of blows and feet and heavy breathing . Then came a mighty effort , and the Invisible Man threw off a couple of his antagonists and rose to his knees . Kemp clung to him in front like a hound to a stag , and a dozen hands gripped , clutched , and tore at the Unseen . The tram conductor suddenly got the neck and shoulders and lugged him back . Down went the heap of struggling men again and rolled over . There was , I am afraid , some savage kicking . Then suddenly a wild scream of “ Mercy ! Mercy ! ” that died down swiftly to a sound like choking .",

Then abandoning the idea of the police station he turned into a little side street , rushed by a greengrocer 's cart , hesitated for the tenth of a second at the door of a sweetstuff shop , and then made for the mouth of an alley that ran back into the main Hill Street again . Two or three little children were playing here , and shrieked and scattered at his apparition , and forthwith doors and windows opened and excited mothers revealed their hearts .

But bless you ! he has n't . “ The Invisible Man it was took ‘ em off to hide ‘ em when I cut and ran for Port Stowe . It 's that Mr. Kemp put people on with the idea of my having ‘ em . ” And then he subsides into a pensive state , watches you furtively , bustles nervously with glasses , and presently leaves the bar . He is a bachelor man — his tastes were ever bachelor , and there are no women folk in the house . Outwardly he buttons — it is expected of him — but in his more vital privacies , in the matter of braces for example , he still turns to string . He conducts his house without enterprise , but with eminent decorum . His movements are slow , and he is a great thinker . But he has a reputation for wisdom and for a respectable parsimony in the village , and his knowledge of the roads of the South of England would beat Cobbett .",
