        "context": "Suddenly she came upon a little table , all made of solid glass . There was nothing on it but a tiny golden key , and Alice 's first idea was that this might belong to one of the doors of the hall ; but , alas ! either the locks were too large , or the key was too small , but , at any rate , it would not open any of them . However , on the second time ‘ round , she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before , and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high . She tried the little golden key in the lock , and to her great delight , it fitted ! Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage , not much larger than a rat-hole ; she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw . How she longed to get out of that dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains , but she could not even get her head through the doorway . “ Oh , ” said Alice , “ how I wish I could shut up like a telescope ! I think I could , if I only knew how to begin . ” Alice went back to the table , half hoping she might find another key on it , or at any rate , a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes . This time she found a little bottle on it ( “ which certainly was not here before , ” said Alice ) , and tied ‘ round the neck of the bottle was a paper label , with the words “ DRINK ME ” beautifully printed on it in large letters . “ No , I 'll look first , ” she said , “ and see whether it 's marked ‘ poison ’ or not , ” for she had never forgotten that , if you drink from a bottle marked “ poison , ” it is almost certain to disagree with you , sooner or later . However , this bottle was not marked “ poison , ” so Alice ventured to taste it , and , finding it very nice ( it had a sort of mixed flavor of cherry-tart , custard , pineapple , roast turkey , toffy and hot buttered toast ) , she very soon finished it off . “ What a curious feeling ! ” said Alice . “ I must be shutting up like a telescope ! ” And so it was indeed ! She was now only ten inches high , and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden . After awhile , finding that nothing more happened , she decided on going into the garden at once ; but , alas for poor Alice ! When she got to the door , she found she had forgotten the little golden key , and when she went back to the table for it , she found she could not possibly reach it : she could see it quite plainly through the glass and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table , but it was too slippery , and when she had tired herself out with trying , the poor little thing sat down and cried . “ Come , there 's no use in crying like that ! ” said Alice to herself rather sharply . “ I advise you to leave off this minute ! ” She generally gave herself very good advice ( though she very seldom followed it ) , and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes .",

Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table : she opened it and found in it a very small cake , on which the words “ EAT ME ” were beautifully marked in currants . “ Well , I 'll eat it , ” said Alice , “ and if it makes me grow larger , I can reach the key ; and if it makes me grow smaller , I can creep under the door : so either way I 'll get into the garden , and I do n't care which happens ! ” She ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself , “ Which way ? Which way ? ” holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way she was growing ; and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size . So she set to work and very soon finished off the cake . “ Curiouser and curiouser ! ” cried Alice ( she was so much surprised that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English ) . “ Now I 'm opening out like the largest telescope that ever was ! Good-by , feet ! Oh , my poor little feet , I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now , dears ? I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you . ” Just at this moment her head struck against the roof of the hall ; in fact , she was now rather more than nine feet high , and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door . Poor Alice ! It was as much as she could do , lying down on one side , to look through into the garden with one eye ; but to get through was more hopeless than ever . She sat down and began to cry again .",

Do come back again , and we wo n't talk about cats , or dogs either , if you do n't like them ! ” When the Mouse heard this , it turned ‘ round and swam slowly back to her ; its face was quite pale , and it said , in a low , trembling voice , “ Let us get to the shore and then I 'll tell you my history and you 'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs . ” It was high time to go , for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it ; there were a Duck and a Dodo , a Lory and an Eaglet , and several other curious creatures . Alice led the way and the whole party swam to the shore . They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank — the birds with draggled feathers , the animals with their fur clinging close to them , and all dripping wet , cross and uncomfortable . The first question , of course , was how to get dry again . They had a consultation about this and after a few minutes , it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them , as if she had known them all her life . At last the Mouse , who seemed to be a person of some authority among them , called out , “ Sit down , all of you , and listen to me ! I 'll soon make you dry enough ! ” They all sat down at once , in a large ring , with the Mouse in the middle .",

Where can I have dropped them , I wonder ? ” Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid-gloves and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them , but they were nowhere to be seen — everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool , and the great hall , with the glass table and the little door , had vanished completely . Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice , and called to her , in an angry tone , “ Why , Mary Ann , what are you doing out here ? Run home this moment and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan ! Quick , now ! ” “ He took me for his housemaid ! ” said Alice , as she ran off . “ How surprised he 'll be when he finds out who I am ! ” As she said this , she came upon a neat little house , on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name “ W.

She went in without knocking and hurried upstairs , in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves .",

She uncorked it and put it to her lips , saying to herself , “ I do hope it 'll make me grow large again , for , really , I 'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing ! ” Before she had drunk half the bottle , she found her head pressing against the ceiling , and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken . She hastily put down the bottle , remarking , “ That 's quite enough — I hope I sha'n ' t grow any more . ” Alas ! It was too late to wish that ! She went on growing and growing and very soon she had to kneel down on the floor . Still she went on growing , and , as a last resource , she put one arm out of the window and one foot up the chimney , and said to herself , “ Now I can do no more , whatever happens . What will become of me ? ” Luckily for Alice , the little magic bottle had now had its full effect and she grew no larger . After a few minutes she heard a voice outside and stopped to listen . “ Mary Ann ! Mary Ann ! ” said the voice . “ Fetch me my gloves this moment ! ” Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs . Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her and she trembled till she shook the house , quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit and had no reason to be afraid of it .

Alice heard it say to itself , “ Then I 'll go ‘ round and get in at the window . ” “ That you wo n't ! ” thought Alice ; and after waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window , she suddenly spread out her hand and made a snatch in the air . She did not get hold of anything , but she heard a little shriek and a fall and a crash of broken glass , from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame or something of that sort . Next came an angry voice — the Rabbit 's — “ Pat ! Pat ! Where are you ? ” And then a voice she had never heard before , “ Sure then , I 'm here ! Digging for apples , yer honor ! ” “ Here !

Alice heard it say to itself , “ Then I 'll go ‘ round and get in at the window . ” “ That you wo n't ! ” thought Alice ; and after waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window , she suddenly spread out her hand and made a snatch in the air . She did not get hold of anything , but she heard a little shriek and a fall and a crash of broken glass , from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame or something of that sort . Next came an angry voice — the Rabbit 's — “ Pat ! Pat ! Where are you ? ” And then a voice she had never heard before , “ Sure then , I 'm here ! Digging for apples , yer honor ! ” “ Here ! Come and help me out of this ! Now tell me , Pat , what 's that in the window ? ” “ Sure , it 's an arm , yer honor ! ” “ Well , it 's got no business there , at any rate ; go and take it away ! ” There was a long silence after this and Alice could only hear whispers now and then , and at last she spread out her hand again and made another snatch in the air . This time there were two little shrieks and more sounds of broken glass . “ I wonder what they 'll do next ! ” thought Alice . “ As for pulling me out of the window , I only wish they could ! ” She waited for some time without hearing anything more . At last came a rumbling of little cart-wheels and the sound of a good many voices all talking together . She made out the words : “ Where 's the other ladder ? Bill 's got the other — Bill ! Here , Bill ! Will the roof bear ?— Who 's to go down the chimney ?— Nay , I sha'n ' t ! You do it ! Here , Bill ! The master says you 've got to go down the chimney ! ” Alice drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could and waited till she heard a little animal scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her ; then she gave one sharp kick and waited to see what would happen next . The first thing she heard was a general chorus of “ There goes Bill ! ” then the Rabbit 's voice alone — “ Catch him , you by the hedge ! ” Then silence and then another confusion of voices — “ Hold up his head — Brandy now — Do n't choke him — What happened to you ? ”",

The other side of what ? ” thought Alice to herself . “ Of the mushroom , ” said the Caterpillar , just as if she had asked it aloud ; and in another moment , it was out of sight . Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute , trying to make out which were the two sides of it . At last she stretched her arms ‘ round it as far as they would go , and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand . “ And now which is which ? ” she said to herself , and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the effect . The next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin — it had struck her foot ! She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change , as she was shrinking rapidly ; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit . Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot that there was hardly room to open her mouth ; but she did it at last and managed to swallow a morsel of the left-hand bit .... “ Come , my head 's free at last ! ” said Alice ; but all she could see , when she looked down , was an immense length of neck , which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her . “ Where have my shoulders got to ? And oh , my poor hands , how is it I can n't see you ? ” She was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction , like a serpent . She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag and was going to dive in among the leaves , when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry — a large pigeon had flown into her face and was beating her violently with its wings . “ Serpent ! ” cried the Pigeon . “ I 'm not a serpent ! ” said Alice indignantly . “ Let me alone ! ” “ I 've tried the roots of trees , and I 've tried banks , and I 've tried hedges , ” the Pigeon went on , “ but those serpents ! There 's no pleasing them ! ” Alice was more and more puzzled . “ As if it was n't trouble enough hatching the eggs , ” said the Pigeon , “ but I must be on the look-out for serpents , night and day !

And oh , my poor hands , how is it I can n't see you ? ” She was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction , like a serpent . She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag and was going to dive in among the leaves , when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry — a large pigeon had flown into her face and was beating her violently with its wings . “ Serpent ! ” cried the Pigeon . “ I 'm not a serpent ! ” said Alice indignantly . “ Let me alone ! ” “ I 've tried the roots of trees , and I 've tried banks , and I 've tried hedges , ” the Pigeon went on , “ but those serpents ! There 's no pleasing them ! ” Alice was more and more puzzled . “ As if it was n't trouble enough hatching the eggs , ” said the Pigeon , “ but I must be on the look-out for serpents , night and day ! And just as I 'd taken the highest tree in the wood , ” continued the Pigeon , raising its voice to a shriek , “ and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last , they must needs come wriggling down from the sky ! Ugh , Serpent ! ” “ But I 'm not a serpent , I tell you ! ” said Alice . “ I 'm a — I 'm a — I 'm a little girl , ” she added rather doubtfully , as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day . “ You 're looking for eggs , I know that well enough , ” said the Pigeon ; “ and what does it matter to me whether you 're a little girl or a serpent ? ” “ It matters a good deal to me , ” said Alice hastily ; “ but I 'm not looking for eggs , as it happens , and if I was , I should n't want yours — I do n't like them raw . ” “ Well , be off , then ! ” said the Pigeon in a sulky tone , as it settled down again into its nest . Alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could , for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches , and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it . After awhile she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands , and she set to work very carefully , nibbling first at one and then at the other , and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter , until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height .",

First , because I 'm on the same side of the door as you are ; secondly , because they 're making such a noise inside , no one could possibly hear you . ” And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise going on within — a constant howling and sneezing , and every now and then a great crash , as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces . “ How am I to get in ? ” asked Alice . “ Are you to get in at all ? ” said the Footman . “ That 's the first question , you know . ” Alice opened the door and went in . The door led right into a large kitchen , which was full of smoke from one end to the other ; the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle , nursing a baby ; the cook was leaning over the fire , stirring a large caldron which seemed to be full of soup . “ There 's certainly too much pepper in that soup ! ” Alice said to herself , as well as she could for sneezing . Even the Duchess sneezed occasionally ; and as for the baby , it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment 's pause . The only two creatures in the kitchen that did not sneeze were the cook and a large cat , which was grinning from ear to ear . “ Please would you tell me , ” said Alice , a little timidly , “ why your cat grins like that ? ”",

You may nurse it a bit , if you like ! ” the Duchess said to Alice , flinging the baby at her as she spoke . “ I must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen , ” and she hurried out of the room .

Would n't it be murder to leave it behind ? ” She said the last words out loud and the little thing grunted in reply . “ If you 're going to turn into a pig , my dear , ” said Alice , “ I 'll have nothing more to do with you .

Two began , in a low voice , “ Why , the fact is , you see , Miss , this here ought to have been a red rose-tree , and we put a white one in by mistake ; and , if the Queen was to find it out , we should all have our heads cut off , you know . So you see , Miss , we 're doing our best , afore she comes , to — ” At this moment , Five , who had been anxiously looking across the garden , called out , “ The Queen ! The Queen ! ” and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces . There was a sound of many footsteps and Alice looked ‘ round , eager to see the Queen . First came ten soldiers carrying clubs , with their hands and feet at the corners : next the ten courtiers ; these were ornamented all over with diamonds . After these came the royal children ; there were ten of them , all ornamented with hearts . Next came the guests , mostly Kings and Queens , and among them Alice recognized the White Rabbit . Then followed the Knave of Hearts , carrying the King 's crown on a crimson velvet cushion ; and last of all this grand procession came THE KING AND THE QUEEN OF HEARTS . When the procession came opposite to Alice , they all stopped and looked at her , and the Queen said severely , “ Who is this ? ” She said it to the Knave of Hearts , who only bowed and smiled in reply . “ My name is Alice , so please Your Majesty , ” said Alice very politely ; but she added to herself , “ Why , they 're only a pack of cards , after all ! ” “ Can you play croquet ? ” shouted the Queen . The question was evidently meant for Alice . “ Yes ! ” said Alice loudly . “ Come on , then ! ” roared the Queen . “ It 's — it 's a very fine day ! ” said a timid voice to Alice . She was walking by the White Rabbit , who was peeping anxiously into her face . “ Very , ” said Alice . “ Where 's the Duchess ? ” “ Hush ! Hush ! ” said the Rabbit . “ She 's under sentence of execution . ” “ What for ? ” said Alice . “ She boxed the Queen 's ears — ” the Rabbit began . “ Get to your places ! ” shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder , and people began running about in all directions , tumbling up against each other . However , they got settled down in a minute or two , and the game began . Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in her life ; it was all ridges and furrows . The croquet balls were live hedgehogs , and the mallets live flamingos and the soldiers had to double themselves up and stand on their hands and feet , to make the arches . The players all played at once , without waiting for turns , quarrelling all the while and fighting for the hedgehogs ; and in a very short time , the Queen was in a furious passion and went stamping about and shouting , “ Off with his head ! ” or “ Off with her head ! ” about once in a minute . “ They 're dreadfully fond of beheading people here , ” thought Alice ; “ the great wonder is that there 's anyone left alive ! ”",

After these came the royal children ; there were ten of them , all ornamented with hearts . Next came the guests , mostly Kings and Queens , and among them Alice recognized the White Rabbit . Then followed the Knave of Hearts , carrying the King 's crown on a crimson velvet cushion ; and last of all this grand procession came THE KING AND THE QUEEN OF HEARTS . When the procession came opposite to Alice , they all stopped and looked at her , and the Queen said severely , “ Who is this ? ” She said it to the Knave of Hearts , who only bowed and smiled in reply . “ My name is Alice , so please Your Majesty , ” said Alice very politely ; but she added to herself , “ Why , they 're only a pack of cards , after all ! ” “ Can you play croquet ? ” shouted the Queen . The question was evidently meant for Alice . “ Yes ! ” said Alice loudly . “ Come on , then ! ” roared the Queen . “ It 's — it 's a very fine day ! ” said a timid voice to Alice . She was walking by the White Rabbit , who was peeping anxiously into her face . “ Very , ” said Alice . “ Where 's the Duchess ? ” “ Hush ! Hush ! ” said the Rabbit . “ She 's under sentence of execution . ” “ What for ? ” said Alice . “ She boxed the Queen 's ears — ” the Rabbit began . “ Get to your places ! ” shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder , and people began running about in all directions , tumbling up against each other . However , they got settled down in a minute or two , and the game began . Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in her life ; it was all ridges and furrows . The croquet balls were live hedgehogs , and the mallets live flamingos and the soldiers had to double themselves up and stand on their hands and feet , to make the arches . The players all played at once , without waiting for turns , quarrelling all the while and fighting for the hedgehogs ; and in a very short time , the Queen was in a furious passion and went stamping about and shouting , “ Off with his head ! ” or “ Off with her head ! ” about once in a minute . “ They 're dreadfully fond of beheading people here , ” thought Alice ; “ the great wonder is that there 's anyone left alive ! ” She was looking about for some way of escape , when she noticed a curious appearance in the air . “ It 's the Cheshire-Cat , ” she said to herself ; “ now I shall have somebody to talk to . ” “ How are you getting on ? ” said the Cat . “ I do n't think they play at all fairly , ” Alice said , in a rather complaining tone ; “ and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can n't hear oneself speak — and they do n't seem to have any rules in particular . ”",

Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper . She was a little startled , however , when she heard the voice of the Duchess close to her ear . “ You 're thinking about something , my dear , and that makes you forget to talk . ” “ The game 's going on rather better now , ” Alice said , by way of keeping up the conversation a little . “ ‘ Tis so , ” said the Duchess ; “ and the moral of that is — ‘ Oh , ‘ tis love , ‘ tis love that makes the world go ‘ round ! ’ ” “ Somebody said , ” Alice whispered , “ that it 's done by everybody minding his own business ! ” “ Ah , well ! It means much the same thing , ” said the Duchess , digging her sharp little chin into Alice 's shoulder , as she added “ and the moral of that is — ‘ Take care of the sense and the sounds will take care of themselves . ’ ” To Alice 's great surprise , the Duchess 's arm that was linked into hers began to tremble . Alice looked up and there stood the Queen in front of them , with her arms folded , frowning like a thunderstorm ! “ Now , I give you fair warning , ” shouted the Queen , stamping on the ground as she spoke , “ either you or your head must be off , and that in about half no time . Take your choice ! ” The Duchess took her choice , and was gone in a moment . “ Let 's go on with the game , ” the Queen said to Alice ; and Alice was too much frightened to say a word , but slowly followed her back to the croquet-ground . All the time they were playing , the Queen never left off quarreling with the other players and shouting , “ Off with his head ! ” or “ Off with her head ! ” By the end of half an hour or so , all the players , except the King , the Queen and Alice , were in custody of the soldiers and under sentence of execution . Then the Queen left off , quite out of breath , and walked away with Alice . Alice heard the King say in a low voice to the company generally , “ You are all pardoned . ” Suddenly the cry “ The Trial 's beginning ! ” was heard in the distance , and Alice ran along with the others . The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived , with a great crowd assembled about them — all sorts of little birds and beasts , as well as the whole pack of cards : the Knave was standing before them , in chains , with a soldier on each side to guard him ; and near the King was the White Rabbit , with a trumpet in one hand and a scroll of parchment in the other . In the very middle of the court was a table , with a large dish of tarts upon it . “ I wish they 'd get the trial done , ” Alice thought , “ and hand ‘ round the refreshments ! ”",

In the very middle of the court was a table , with a large dish of tarts upon it . “ I wish they 'd get the trial done , ” Alice thought , “ and hand ‘ round the refreshments ! ” The judge , by the way , was the King and he wore his crown over his great wig . “ That 's the jury-box , ” thought Alice ; “ and those twelve creatures ( some were animals and some were birds ) I suppose they are the jurors . ” Just then the White Rabbit cried out “ Silence in the court ! ” “ Herald , read the accusation ! ” said the King . On this , the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet , then unrolled the parchment-scroll and read as follows : “ The Queen of Hearts , she made some tarts , All on a summer day ; The Knave of Hearts , he stole those tarts And took them quite away ! ” “ Call the first witness , ” said the King ; and the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and called out , “ First witness ! ” The first witness was the Hatter . He came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread and butter in the other . “ You ought to have finished , ” said the King . “ When did you begin ? ” The Hatter looked at the March Hare , who had followed him into the court , arm in arm with the Dormouse . “ Fourteenth of March , I think it was , ” he said . “ Give your evidence , ” said the King , “ and do n't be nervous , or I 'll have you executed on the spot . ” This did not seem to encourage the witness at all ; he kept shifting from one foot to the other , looking uneasily at the Queen , and , in his confusion , he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread and butter . Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation — she was beginning to grow larger again . The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread and butter and went down on one knee . “ I 'm a poor man , Your Majesty , ” he began . “ You 're a very poor speaker , ” said the King . “ You may go , ” said the King , and the Hatter hurriedly left the court . “ Call the next witness ! ” said the King . The next witness was the Duchess 's cook . She carried the pepper-box in her hand and the people near the door began sneezing all at once . “ Give your evidence , ” said the King . “ Sha'n ' t , ” said the cook . The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit , who said , in a low voice , “ Your Majesty must cross-examine this witness . ”",

There was a general clapping of hands at this . “ Read them , ” he added , turning to the White Rabbit . There was dead silence in the court whilst the White Rabbit read out the verses . “ That 's the most important piece of evidence we 've heard yet , ” said the King . “ I do n't believe there 's an atom of meaning in it , ” ventured Alice . “ If there 's no meaning in it , ” said the King , “ that saves a world of trouble , you know , as we need n't try to find any .

Nobody moved . “ Who cares for you ? ” said Alice ( she had grown to her full size by this time ) . “ You 're nothing but a pack of cards ! ” At this , the whole pack rose up in the air and came flying down upon her ; she gave a little scream , half of fright and half of anger , and tried to beat them off , and found herself lying on the bank , with her head in the lap of her sister , who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face . “ Wake up , Alice dear ! ” said her sister . “ Why , what a long sleep you 've had ! ” “ Oh , I 've had such a curious dream ! ” said Alice .
