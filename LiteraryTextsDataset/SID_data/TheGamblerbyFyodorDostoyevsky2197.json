        "context": "During the meal the Frenchman was in great feather : he was discursive and pompous to every one . In Moscow too , I remembered , he had blown a great many bubbles . Interminably he discoursed on finance and Russian politics , and though , at times , the General made feints to contradict him , he did so humbly , and as though wishing not wholly to lose sight of his own dignity . For myself , I was in a curious frame of mind . Even before luncheon was half finished I had asked myself the old , eternal question : “ WHY do I continue to dance attendance upon the General , instead of having left him and his family long ago ? ” Every now and then I would glance at Polina Alexandrovna , but she paid me no attention ; until eventually I became so irritated that I decided to play the boor . First of all I suddenly , and for no reason whatever , plunged loudly and gratuitously into the general conversation . Above everything I wanted to pick a quarrel with the Frenchman ; and , with that end in view I turned to the General , and exclaimed in an overbearing sort of way — indeed , I think that I actually interrupted him — that that summer it had been almost impossible for a Russian to dine anywhere at tables d'hote . The General bent upon me a glance of astonishment . “ If one is a man of self-respect , ” I went on , “ one risks abuse by so doing , and is forced to put up with insults of every kind . Both at Paris and on the Rhine , and even in Switzerland — there are so many Poles , with their sympathisers , the French , at these tables d'hote that one cannot get a word in edgeways if one happens only to be a Russian . ” This I said in French . The General eyed me doubtfully , for he did not know whether to be angry or merely to feel surprised that I should so far forget myself . “ Of course , one always learns SOMETHING EVERYWHERE , ” said the Frenchman in a careless , contemptuous sort of tone . “ In Paris , too , I had a dispute with a Pole , ” I continued , “ and then with a French officer who supported him . After that a section of the Frenchmen present took my part . They did so as soon as I told them the story of how once I threatened to spit into Monsignor 's coffee . ” “ To spit into it ? ” the General inquired with grave disapproval in his tone , and a stare , of astonishment , while the Frenchman looked at me unbelievingly . “ Just so , ” I replied . “ You must know that , on one occasion , when , for two days , I had felt certain that at any moment I might have to depart for Rome on business , I repaired to the Embassy of the Holy See in Paris , to have my passport visaed . There I encountered a sacristan of about fifty , and a man dry and cold of mien . After listening politely , but with great reserve , to my account of myself , this sacristan asked me to wait a little . I was in a great hurry to depart , but of course I sat down , pulled out a copy of L'Opinion Nationale , and fell to reading an extraordinary piece of invective against Russia which it happened to contain . As I was thus engaged I heard some one enter an adjoining room and ask for Monsignor ; after which I saw the sacristan make a low bow to the visitor , and then another bow as the visitor took his leave . I ventured to remind the good man of my own business also ; whereupon , with an expression of , if anything , increased dryness , he again asked me to wait . Soon a third visitor arrived who , like myself , had come on business ( he was an Austrian of some sort ) ; and as soon as ever he had stated his errand he was conducted upstairs ! This made me very angry . I rose , approached the sacristan , and told him that , since Monsignor was receiving callers , his lordship might just as well finish off my affair as well . Upon this the sacristan shrunk back in astonishment . It simply passed his understanding that any insignificant Russian should dare to compare himself with other visitors of Monsignor 's ! In a tone of the utmost effrontery , as though he were delighted to have a chance of insulting me , he looked me up and down , and then said : “ Do you suppose that Monsignor is going to put aside his coffee for YOU ? ” But I only cried the louder : “ Let me tell you that I am going to SPIT into that coffee ! Yes , and if you do not get me my passport visaed this very minute , I shall take it to Monsignor myself . ”",

Listen to me . Take these 700 florins , and go and play roulette with them . Win as much for me as you can , for I am badly in need of money . ” So saying , she called Nadia back to her side , and entered the Casino , where she joined the rest of our party . For myself , I took , in musing astonishment , the first path to the left . Something had seemed to strike my brain when she told me to go and play roulette . Strangely enough , that something had also seemed to make me hesitate , and to set me analysing my feelings with regard to her . In fact , during the two weeks of my absence I had felt far more at my ease than I did now , on the day of my return ; although , while travelling , I had moped like an imbecile , rushed about like a man in a fever , and actually beheld her in my dreams . Indeed , on one occasion ( this happened in Switzerland , when I was asleep in the train ) I had spoken aloud to her , and set all my fellow-travellers laughing . Again , therefore , I put to myself the question : “ Do I , or do I not love her ? ” and again I could return myself no answer or , rather , for the hundredth time I told myself that I detested her . Yes , I detested her ; there were moments ( more especially at the close of our talks together ) when I would gladly have given half my life to have strangled her ! I swear that , had there , at such moments , been a sharp knife ready to my hand , I would have seized that knife with pleasure , and plunged it into her breast . Yet I also swear that if , on the Shlangenberg , she had REALLY said to me , “ Leap into that abyss , ” I should have leapt into it , and with equal pleasure . Yes , this I knew well . One way or the other , the thing must soon be ended . She , too , knew it in some curious way ; the thought that I was fully conscious of her inaccessibility , and of the impossibility of my ever realising my dreams , afforded her , I am certain , the keenest possible pleasure . Otherwise , is it likely that she , the cautious and clever woman that she was , would have indulged in this familiarity and openness with me ? Hitherto ( I concluded ) she had looked upon me in the same light that the old Empress did upon her servant — the Empress who hesitated not to unrobe herself before her slave , since she did not account a slave a man . Yes , often Polina must have taken me for something less than a man ! ”",

Listen to me . Take these 700 florins , and go and play roulette with them . Win as much for me as you can , for I am badly in need of money . ” So saying , she called Nadia back to her side , and entered the Casino , where she joined the rest of our party . For myself , I took , in musing astonishment , the first path to the left . Something had seemed to strike my brain when she told me to go and play roulette . Strangely enough , that something had also seemed to make me hesitate , and to set me analysing my feelings with regard to her . In fact , during the two weeks of my absence I had felt far more at my ease than I did now , on the day of my return ; although , while travelling , I had moped like an imbecile , rushed about like a man in a fever , and actually beheld her in my dreams . Indeed , on one occasion ( this happened in Switzerland , when I was asleep in the train ) I had spoken aloud to her , and set all my fellow-travellers laughing . Again , therefore , I put to myself the question : “ Do I , or do I not love her ? ” and again I could return myself no answer or , rather , for the hundredth time I told myself that I detested her . Yes , I detested her ; there were moments ( more especially at the close of our talks together ) when I would gladly have given half my life to have strangled her ! I swear that , had there , at such moments , been a sharp knife ready to my hand , I would have seized that knife with pleasure , and plunged it into her breast . Yet I also swear that if , on the Shlangenberg , she had REALLY said to me , “ Leap into that abyss , ” I should have leapt into it , and with equal pleasure . Yes , this I knew well . One way or the other , the thing must soon be ended . She , too , knew it in some curious way ; the thought that I was fully conscious of her inaccessibility , and of the impossibility of my ever realising my dreams , afforded her , I am certain , the keenest possible pleasure . Otherwise , is it likely that she , the cautious and clever woman that she was , would have indulged in this familiarity and openness with me ? Hitherto ( I concluded ) she had looked upon me in the same light that the old Empress did upon her servant — the Empress who hesitated not to unrobe herself before her slave , since she did not account a slave a man . Yes , often Polina must have taken me for something less than a man ! ”",

A host of new and unknown factors seemed to have arisen during the last two weeks . Well , it behoved me to divine them , and to probe them , and that as soon as possible . Yet not now : at the present moment I must repair to the roulette-table .",

        "context": "For three weeks I had known of her intention to take to roulette . She had even warned me that she would like me to play on her behalf , since it was unbecoming for her to play in person ; and , from the tone of her words I had gathered that there was something on her mind besides a mere desire to win money . As if money could matter to HER ! No , she had some end in view , and there were circumstances at which I could guess , but which I did not know for certain . True , the slavery and abasement in which she held me might have given me ( such things often do so ) the power to question her with abrupt directness ( seeing that , inasmuch as I figured in her eyes as a mere slave and nonentity , she could not very well have taken offence at any rude curiosity ) ; but the fact was that , though she let me question her , she never returned me a single answer , and at times did not so much as notice me . That is how matters stood . Next day there was a good deal of talk about a telegram which , four days ago , had been sent to St. Petersburg , but to which there had come no answer . The General was visibly disturbed and moody , for the matter concerned his mother . The Frenchman , too , was excited , and after dinner the whole party talked long and seriously together — the Frenchman 's tone being extraordinarily presumptuous and offhand to everybody . It almost reminded one of the proverb , “ Invite a man to your table , and soon he will place his feet upon it . ” Even to Polina he was brusque almost to the point of rudeness . Yet still he seemed glad to join us in our walks in the Casino , or in our rides and drives about the town . I had long been aware of certain circumstances which bound the General to him ; I had long been aware that in Russia they had hatched some scheme together although I did not know whether the plot had come to anything , or whether it was still only in the stage of being talked of . Likewise I was aware , in part , of a family secret — namely , that , last year , the Frenchman had bailed the General out of debt , and given him 30 , 000 roubles wherewith to pay his Treasury dues on retiring from the service . And now , of course , the General was in a vice — although the chief part in the affair was being played by Mlle . Blanche . Yes , of this last I had no doubt . But WHO was this Mlle . Blanche ? It was said of her that she was a Frenchwoman of good birth who , living with her mother , possessed a colossal fortune . It was also said that she was some relation to the Marquis , but only a distant one a cousin , or cousin-german , or something of the sort . Likewise I knew that , up to the time of my journey to Paris , she and the Frenchman had been more ceremonious towards our party — they had stood on a much more precise and delicate footing with them ; but that now their acquaintanceship — their friendship , their intimacy — had taken on a much more off-hand and rough-and-ready air . Perhaps they thought that our means were too modest for them , and , therefore , unworthy of politeness or reticence . Also , for the last three days I had noticed certain looks which Astley had kept throwing at Mlle . Blanche and her mother ; and it had occurred to me that he must have had some previous acquaintance with the pair . I had even surmised that the Frenchman too must have met Mr. Astley before . Astley was a man so shy , reserved , and taciturn in his manner that one might have looked for anything from him . At all events the Frenchman accorded him only the slightest of greetings , and scarcely even looked at him . Certainly he did not seem to be afraid of him ; which was intelligible enough . But why did Mlle . Blanche also never look at the Englishman ?— particularly since , a propos of something or another , the Marquis had declared the Englishman to be immensely and indubitably rich ? Was not that a sufficient reason to make Mlle . Blanche look at the Englishman ? Anyway the General seemed extremely uneasy ; and , one could well understand what a telegram to announce the death of his mother would mean for him !",

I pressed forward towards the middle of the room until I had secured a seat at a croupier 's elbow . Then I began to play in timid fashion , venturing only twenty or thirty gulden at a time .

What more have I to tell ? Well , this — that matters bear just as hardly upon the eldest son . Perhaps he has his Gretchen to whom his heart is bound ; but he cannot marry her , for the reason that he has not yet amassed sufficient gulden . So , the pair wait on in a mood of sincere and virtuous expectation , and smilingly deposit themselves in pawn the while . Gretchen 's cheeks grow sunken , and she begins to wither ; until at last , after some twenty years , their substance has multiplied , and sufficient gulden have been honourably and virtuously accumulated .

In turn the eldest son becomes a virtuous ‘ Fater , ’ and the old story begins again . In fifty or sixty years ’ time the grandson of the original ‘ Fater ’ will have amassed a considerable sum ; and that sum he will hand over to , his son , and the latter to HIS son , and so on for several generations ; until at length there will issue a Baron Rothschild , or a ‘ Hoppe and Company , ’ or the devil knows what !

Indeed , whenever he embarked upon anything that in the least exceeded the limits of daily small-talk , he left unfinished what he was saying .

As for Polina , she had looked on with serene indifference . She seemed to have heard neither my voice nor any other during the progress of the meal . Yes , she had been extraordinarily meditative . Yet , on leaving the table , she immediately ordered me to accompany her for a walk . We took the children with us , and set out for the fountain in the Park . I was in such an irritated frame of mind that in rude and abrupt fashion I blurted out a question as to “ why our Marquis de Griers had ceased to accompany her for strolls , or to speak to her for days together . ” “ Because he is a brute , ” she replied in rather a curious way .

Each such ‘ Fater ’ has his family , and in the evenings they read improving books aloud . Over their roof-trees there murmur elms and chestnuts ; the sun has sunk to his rest ; a stork is roosting on the gable ; and all is beautifully poetic and touching . Do not be angry , General . Let me tell you something that is even more touching than that . I can remember how , of an evening , my own father , now dead , used to sit under the lime trees in his little garden , and to read books aloud to myself and my mother . Yes , I know how things ought to be done . Yet every German family is bound to slavery and to submission to its ‘ Fater . ’ They work like oxen , and amass wealth like Jews . Suppose the ‘ Fater ’ has put by a certain number of gulden which he hands over to his eldest son , in order that the said son may acquire a trade or a small plot of land . Well , one result is to deprive the daughter of a dowry , and so leave her among the unwedded . For the same reason , the parents will have to sell the younger son into bondage or the ranks of the army , in order that he may earn more towards the family capital . Yes , such things ARE done , for I have been making inquiries on the subject . It is all done out of sheer rectitude — out of a rectitude which is magnified to the point of the younger son believing that he has been RIGHTLY sold , and that it is simply idyllic for the victim to rejoice when he is made over into pledge . What more have I to tell ? Well , this — that matters bear just as hardly upon the eldest son . Perhaps he has his Gretchen to whom his heart is bound ; but he cannot marry her , for the reason that he has not yet amassed sufficient gulden . So , the pair wait on in a mood of sincere and virtuous expectation , and smilingly deposit themselves in pawn the while . Gretchen 's cheeks grow sunken , and she begins to wither ; until at last , after some twenty years , their substance has multiplied , and sufficient gulden have been honourably and virtuously accumulated . Then the ‘ Fater ’ blesses his forty-year-old heir and the thirty-five-year-old Gretchen with the sunken bosom and the scarlet nose ; after which he bursts , into tears , reads the pair a lesson on morality , and dies . In turn the eldest son becomes a virtuous ‘ Fater , ’ and the old story begins again . In fifty or sixty years ’ time the grandson of the original ‘ Fater ’ will have amassed a considerable sum ; and that sum he will hand over to , his son , and the latter to HIS son , and so on for several generations ; until at length there will issue a Baron Rothschild , or a ‘ Hoppe and Company , ’ or the devil knows what ! Is it not a beautiful spectacle — the spectacle of a century or two of inherited labour , patience , intellect , rectitude , character , perseverance , and calculation , with a stork sitting on the roof above it all ? What is more ; they think there can never be anything better than this ; wherefore , from their point of view they begin to judge the rest of the world , and to censure all who are at fault — that is to say , who are not exactly like themselves . Yes , there you have it in a nutshell . For my own part , I would rather grow fat after the Russian manner , or squander my whole substance at roulette . I have no wish to be ‘ Hoppe and Company ’ at the end of five generations . I want the money for MYSELF , for in no way do I look upon my personality as necessary to , or meet to be given over to , capital . I may be wrong , but there you have it . Those are MY views . ” “ How far you may be right in what you have said I do not know , ” remarked the General moodily ; “ but I DO know that you are becoming an insufferable farceur whenever you are given the least chance . ” As usual , he left his sentence unfinished . Indeed , whenever he embarked upon anything that in the least exceeded the limits of daily small-talk , he left unfinished what he was saying . The Frenchman had listened to me contemptuously , with a slight protruding of his eyes ; but , he could not have understood very much of my harangue . As for Polina , she had looked on with serene indifference . She seemed to have heard neither my voice nor any other during the progress of the meal . Yes , she had been extraordinarily meditative . Yet , on leaving the table , she immediately ordered me to accompany her for a walk . We took the children with us , and set out for the fountain in the Park . I was in such an irritated frame of mind that in rude and abrupt fashion I blurted out a question as to “ why our Marquis de Griers had ceased to accompany her for strolls , or to speak to her for days together . ” “ Because he is a brute , ” she replied in rather a curious way . It was the first time that I had heard her speak so of De Griers : consequently , I was momentarily awed into silence by this expression of resentment .",

Consequently , if the General 's mother does not die , the Frenchman will become the absolute possessor of everything which he now holds only in pledge . ” “ Then it is really the case that everything is mortgaged ?

When they were but a few paces distant from me I took off my hat , and bowed . I remember that the Baroness was clad in a voluminous silk dress , pale grey in colour , and adorned with flounces and a crinoline and train . Also , she was short and inordinately stout , while her gross , flabby chin completely concealed her neck . Her face was purple , and the little eyes in it had an impudent , malicious expression . Yet she walked as though she were conferring a favour upon everybody by so doing . As for the Baron , he was tall , wizened , bony-faced after the German fashion , spectacled , and , apparently , about forty-five years of age . Also , he had legs which seemed to begin almost at his chest — or , rather , at his chin ! Yet , for all his air of peacock-like conceit , his clothes sagged a little , and his face wore a sheepish air which might have passed for profundity . These details I noted within a space of a few seconds . At first my bow and the fact that I had my hat in my hand barely caught their attention . The Baron only scowled a little , and the Baroness swept straight on . “ Madame la Baronne , ” said I , loudly and distinctly — embroidering each word , as it were — “ j'ai l'honneur d'etre votre esclave . ” Then I bowed again , put on my hat , and walked past the Baron with a rude smile on my face . Polina had ordered me merely to take off my hat : the bow and the general effrontery were of my own invention . God knows what instigated me to perpetrate the outrage ! In my frenzy I felt as though I were walking on air . “ Hein ! ” ejaculated — or , rather , growled — the Baron as he turned towards me in angry surprise . I too turned round , and stood waiting in pseudo-courteous expectation . Yet still I wore on my face an impudent smile as I gazed at him . He seemed to hesitate , and his brows contracted to their utmost limits . Every moment his visage was growing darker . The Baroness also turned in my direction , and gazed at me in wrathful perplexity , while some of the passers-by also began to stare at us , and others of them halted outright . “ Hein ! ” the Baron vociferated again , with a redoubled growl and a note of growing wrath in his voice . “ Ja wohl ! ” I replied , still looking him in the eyes . “ Sind sie rasend ? ” he exclaimed , brandishing his stick , and , apparently , beginning to feel nervous . Perhaps it was my costume which intimidated him , for I was well and fashionably dressed , after the manner of a man who belongs to indisputably good society .",

I remember that the Baroness was clad in a voluminous silk dress , pale grey in colour , and adorned with flounces and a crinoline and train . Also , she was short and inordinately stout , while her gross , flabby chin completely concealed her neck . Her face was purple , and the little eyes in it had an impudent , malicious expression . Yet she walked as though she were conferring a favour upon everybody by so doing . As for the Baron , he was tall , wizened , bony-faced after the German fashion , spectacled , and , apparently , about forty-five years of age . Also , he had legs which seemed to begin almost at his chest — or , rather , at his chin ! Yet , for all his air of peacock-like conceit , his clothes sagged a little , and his face wore a sheepish air which might have passed for profundity . These details I noted within a space of a few seconds . At first my bow and the fact that I had my hat in my hand barely caught their attention . The Baron only scowled a little , and the Baroness swept straight on . “ Madame la Baronne , ” said I , loudly and distinctly — embroidering each word , as it were — “ j'ai l'honneur d'etre votre esclave . ” Then I bowed again , put on my hat , and walked past the Baron with a rude smile on my face . Polina had ordered me merely to take off my hat : the bow and the general effrontery were of my own invention . God knows what instigated me to perpetrate the outrage ! In my frenzy I felt as though I were walking on air . “ Hein ! ” ejaculated — or , rather , growled — the Baron as he turned towards me in angry surprise . I too turned round , and stood waiting in pseudo-courteous expectation . Yet still I wore on my face an impudent smile as I gazed at him . He seemed to hesitate , and his brows contracted to their utmost limits . Every moment his visage was growing darker . The Baroness also turned in my direction , and gazed at me in wrathful perplexity , while some of the passers-by also began to stare at us , and others of them halted outright . “ Hein ! ” the Baron vociferated again , with a redoubled growl and a note of growing wrath in his voice . “ Ja wohl ! ” I replied , still looking him in the eyes . “ Sind sie rasend ? ” he exclaimed , brandishing his stick , and , apparently , beginning to feel nervous . Perhaps it was my costume which intimidated him , for I was well and fashionably dressed , after the manner of a man who belongs to indisputably good society .",

Moreover , on the three previous occasions that I have met the Baroness she has walked towards me as though I were a worm which could easily be crushed with the foot . Not unnaturally , I too possess a measure of self-respect ; wherefore , on THIS occasion I took off my hat , and said politely ( yes , I assure you it was said politely ): ‘ Madame , j'ai l'honneur d'etre votre esclave . ’ Then the Baron turned round , and said ‘ Hein ! ’ ; whereupon I felt moved to ejaculate in answer ‘ Ja wohl ! ’ Twice I shouted it at him — the first time in an ordinary tone , and the second time with the greatest prolonging of the words of which I was capable . That is all . ” I must confess that this puerile explanation gave me great pleasure . I felt a strong desire to overlay the incident with an even added measure of grossness ; so , the further I proceeded , the more did the gusto of my proceeding increase . “ You are only making fun of me ! ” vociferated the General as , turning to the Frenchman , he declared that my bringing about of the incident had been gratuitous . De Griers smiled contemptuously , and shrugged his shoulders . “ Do not think THAT , ” I put in . “ It was not so at all . I grant you that my behaviour was bad — I fully confess that it was so , and make no secret of the fact . I would even go so far as to grant you that my behaviour might well be called stupid and indecent tomfoolery ; but , MORE than that it was not . Also , let me tell you that I am very sorry for my conduct . Yet there is one circumstance which , in my eyes , almost absolves me from regret in the matter . Of late — that is to say , for the last two or three weeks — I have been feeling not at all well . That is to say , I have been in a sick , nervous , irritable , fanciful condition , so that I have periodically lost control over myself . For instance , on more than one occasion I have tried to pick a quarrel even with Monsieur le Marquise here ; and , under the circumstances , he had no choice but to answer me . In short , I have recently been showing signs of ill-health .

On the other hand , the General promises that at the first favourable opportunity he will receive you back into his household , and , in the meantime , will credit you with your salary — with ‘ vos appointements . ’ Surely that will suit you , will it not ? ” Very quietly I replied that he ( the Frenchman ) was labouring under a delusion ; that perhaps , after all , I should not be expelled from the Baron 's presence , but , on the contrary , be listened to ; finally , that I should be glad if Monsieur de Griers would confess that he was now visiting me merely in order to see how far I intended to go in the affair . “ Good heavens ! ” cried de Griers . “ Seeing that the General takes such an interest in the matter , is there anything very unnatural in his desiring also to know your plans ? ” Again I began my explanations , but the Frenchman only fidgeted and rolled his head about as he listened with an expression of manifest and unconcealed irony on his face . In short , he adopted a supercilious attitude . For my own part , I endeavoured to pretend that I took the affair very seriously . I declared that , since the Baron had gone and complained of me to the General , as though I were a mere servant of the General 's , he had , in the first place , lost me my post , and , in the second place , treated me like a person to whom , as to one not qualified to answer for himself , it was not even worth while to speak . Naturally , I said , I felt insulted at this . Yet , comprehending as I did , differences of years , of social status , and so forth ( here I could scarcely help smiling ) , I was not anxious to bring about further scenes by going personally to demand or to request satisfaction of the Baron . All that I felt was that I had a right to go in person and beg the Baron 's and the Baroness 's pardon — the more so since , of late , I had been feeling unwell and unstrung , and had been in a fanciful condition . And so forth , and so forth . Yet ( I continued ) the Baron 's offensive behaviour to me of yesterday ( that is to say , the fact of his referring the matter to the General ) as well as his insistence that the General should deprive me of my post , had placed me in such a position that I could not well express my regret to him ( the Baron ) and to his good lady , for the reason that in all probability both he and the Baroness , with the world at large , would imagine that I was doing so merely because I hoped , by my action , to recover my post . Hence , I found myself forced to request the Baron to express to me HIS OWN regrets , as well as to express them in the most unqualified manner — to say , in fact , that he had never had any wish to insult me . After the Baron had done THAT , I should , for my part , at once feel free to express to him , whole-heartedly and without reserve , my own regrets . “ In short , ” I declared in conclusion , “ my one desire is that the Baron may make it possible for me to adopt the latter course . ”",

Having small knowledge of the Russian tongue , I lost most of what was said last night ; but , the General has now explained matters , and I must confess that — ” “ See here , Monsieur de Griers , ” I interrupted . “ I understand that you have undertaken to act in this affair as an intermediary . Of course I am only ‘ un utchitel , ’ a tutor , and have never claimed to be an intimate of this household , nor to stand on at all familiar terms with it . Consequently , I do not know the whole of its circumstances . Yet pray explain to me this : have you yourself become one of its members , seeing that you are beginning to take such a part in everything , and are now present as an intermediary ? ” The Frenchman seemed not over-pleased at my question . It was one which was too outspoken for his taste — and he had no mind to be frank with me . “ I am connected with the General , ” he said drily , “ partly through business affairs , and partly through special circumstances . My principal has sent me merely to ask you to forego your intentions of last evening . What you contemplate is , I have no doubt , very clever ; yet he has charged me to represent to you that you have not the slightest chance of succeeding in your end , since not only will the Baron refuse to receive you , but also he ( the Baron ) has at his disposal every possible means for obviating further unpleasantness from you . Surely you can see that yourself ? What , then , would be the good of going on with it all ? On the other hand , the General promises that at the first favourable opportunity he will receive you back into his household , and , in the meantime , will credit you with your salary — with ‘ vos appointements . ’ Surely that will suit you , will it not ? ” Very quietly I replied that he ( the Frenchman ) was labouring under a delusion ; that perhaps , after all , I should not be expelled from the Baron 's presence , but , on the contrary , be listened to ; finally , that I should be glad if Monsieur de Griers would confess that he was now visiting me merely in order to see how far I intended to go in the affair . “ Good heavens ! ” cried de Griers . “ Seeing that the General takes such an interest in the matter , is there anything very unnatural in his desiring also to know your plans ? ” Again I began my explanations , but the Frenchman only fidgeted and rolled his head about as he listened with an expression of manifest and unconcealed irony on his face . In short , he adopted a supercilious attitude . For my own part , I endeavoured to pretend that I took the affair very seriously . I declared that , since the Baron had gone and complained of me to the General , as though I were a mere servant of the General 's , he had , in the first place , lost me my post , and , in the second place , treated me like a person to whom , as to one not qualified to answer for himself , it was not even worth while to speak . Naturally , I said , I felt insulted at this . Yet , comprehending as I did , differences of years , of social status , and so forth ( here I could scarcely help smiling ) , I was not anxious to bring about further scenes by going personally to demand or to request satisfaction of the Baron . All that I felt was that I had a right to go in person and beg the Baron 's and the Baroness 's pardon — the more so since , of late , I had been feeling unwell and unstrung , and had been in a fanciful condition . And so forth , and so forth . Yet ( I continued ) the Baron 's offensive behaviour to me of yesterday ( that is to say , the fact of his referring the matter to the General ) as well as his insistence that the General should deprive me of my post , had placed me in such a position that I could not well express my regret to him ( the Baron ) and to his good lady , for the reason that in all probability both he and the Baroness , with the world at large , would imagine that I was doing so merely because I hoped , by my action , to recover my post . Hence , I found myself forced to request the Baron to express to me HIS OWN regrets , as well as to express them in the most unqualified manner — to say , in fact , that he had never had any wish to insult me . After the Baron had done THAT , I should , for my part , at once feel free to express to him , whole-heartedly and without reserve , my own regrets . “ In short , ” I declared in conclusion , “ my one desire is that the Baron may make it possible for me to adopt the latter course . ”",

Yet , comprehending as I did , differences of years , of social status , and so forth ( here I could scarcely help smiling ) , I was not anxious to bring about further scenes by going personally to demand or to request satisfaction of the Baron . All that I felt was that I had a right to go in person and beg the Baron 's and the Baroness 's pardon — the more so since , of late , I had been feeling unwell and unstrung , and had been in a fanciful condition . And so forth , and so forth . Yet ( I continued ) the Baron 's offensive behaviour to me of yesterday ( that is to say , the fact of his referring the matter to the General ) as well as his insistence that the General should deprive me of my post , had placed me in such a position that I could not well express my regret to him ( the Baron ) and to his good lady , for the reason that in all probability both he and the Baroness , with the world at large , would imagine that I was doing so merely because I hoped , by my action , to recover my post . Hence , I found myself forced to request the Baron to express to me HIS OWN regrets , as well as to express them in the most unqualified manner — to say , in fact , that he had never had any wish to insult me . After the Baron had done THAT , I should , for my part , at once feel free to express to him , whole-heartedly and without reserve , my own regrets . “ In short , ” I declared in conclusion , “ my one desire is that the Baron may make it possible for me to adopt the latter course . ” “ Oh fie ! What refinements and subtleties ! ” exclaimed De Griers . “ Besides , what have you to express regret for ? Confess , Monsieur , Monsieur — pardon me , but I have forgotten your name — confess , I say , that all this is merely a plan to annoy the General ? Or perhaps , you have some other and special end in view ? Eh ? ” “ In return you must pardon ME , mon cher Marquis , and tell me what you have to do with it . ” “ The General — ” “ But what of the General ? Last night he said that , for some reason or another , it behoved him to ‘ move with especial care at present ; ’ wherefore , he was feeling nervous . But I did not understand the reference . ” “ Yes , there DO exist special reasons for his doing so , ” assented De Griers in a conciliatory tone , yet with rising anger . “ You are acquainted with Mlle . de Cominges , are you not ? ” “ Mlle . Blanche , you mean ? ” “ Yes , Mlle . Blanche de Cominges . Doubtless you know also that the General is in love with this young lady , and may even be about to marry her before he leaves here ? Imagine , therefore , what any scene or scandal would entail upon him ! ” “ I cannot see that the marriage scheme need , be affected by scenes or scandals . ” “ Mais le Baron est si irascible — un caractere prussien , vous savez ! Enfin il fera une querelle d'Allemand . ” “ I do not care , ” I replied , “ seeing that I no longer belong to his household ” ( of set purpose I was trying to talk as senselessly as possible ) . “ But is it quite settled that Mlle . is to marry the General ? What are they waiting for ? Why should they conceal such a matter — at all events from ourselves , the General 's own party ? ” “ I cannot tell you . The marriage is not yet a settled affair , for they are awaiting news from Russia . The General has business transactions to arrange . ” “ Ah ! Connected , doubtless , with madame his mother ? ” De Griers shot at me a glance of hatred . “ To cut things short , ” he interrupted , “ I have complete confidence in your native politeness , as well as in your tact and good sense . I feel sure that you will do what I suggest , even if it is only for the sake of this family which has received you as a kinsman into its bosom and has always loved and respected you . ”",

It would have been better if he had laughed outright . “ Very well , ” I said , “ you can tell Mlle . not to disturb herself .

Instead of chattering about trifles , you ought to have delivered me the missive at once — if you have really come commissioned as you say . ” “ Well , pardon some natural haste on my part , for the situation is so strange . I wished first to gain some personal knowledge of your intentions ; and , moreover , I did not know the contents of the note , and thought that it could be given you at any time . ” “ I understand , ” I replied . “ So you were ordered to hand me the note only in the last resort , and if you could not otherwise appease me ?

For instance , she thrust her way into the file of women roulette-players in the exact fashion of those ladies who , to clear a space for themselves at the tables , push their fellow-players roughly aside . Doubtless you have noticed them ? ” “ Yes , certainly . ” “ Well , they are not worth noticing . To the annoyance of the decent public they are allowed to remain here — at all events such of them as daily change 4000 franc notes at the tables ( though , as soon as ever these women cease to do so , they receive an invitation to depart ) . However , Mlle . Zelma continued to change notes of this kind , but her play grew more and more unsuccessful , despite the fact that such ladies ’ luck is frequently good , for they have a surprising amount of cash at their disposal . Suddenly , the Count too disappeared , even as the Prince had done , and that same evening Mlle . Zelma was forced to appear in the Casino alone . On this occasion no one offered her a greeting . Two days later she had come to the end of her resources ; whereupon , after staking and losing her last louis d'or she chanced to look around her , and saw standing by her side the Baron Burmergelm , who had been eyeing her with fixed disapproval . To his distaste , however , Mlle . paid no attention , but , turning to him with her well-known smile , requested him to stake , on her behalf , ten louis on the red . Later that evening a complaint from the Baroness led the authorities to request Mlle . not to re-enter the Casino . If you feel in any way surprised that I should know these petty and unedifying details , the reason is that I had them from a relative of mine who , later that evening , drove Mlle . Zelma in his carriage from Roulettenberg to Spa . Now , mark you , Mlle . wants to become Madame General , in order that , in future , she may be spared the receipt of such invitations from Casino authorities as she received three years ago . At present she is not playing ; but that is only because , according to the signs , she is lending money to other players . Yes , that is a much more paying game . I even suspect that the unfortunate General is himself in her debt , as well as , perhaps , also De Griers . Or , it may be that the latter has entered into a partnership with her . Consequently you yourself will see that , until the marriage shall have been consummated , Mlle . would scarcely like to have the attention of the Baron and the Baroness drawn to herself . In short , to any one in her position , a scandal would be most detrimental . You form a member of the menage of these people ; wherefore , any act of yours might cause such a scandal — and the more so since daily she appears in public arm in arm with the General or with Mlle . Polina . NOW do you understand ? ”",

We had left the cafe long ago , without even noticing that we had done so . “ Yes , I DID hear a woman 's voice calling , but whose I do not know . The someone was calling you in Russian . Ah ! NOW I can see whence the cries come . They come from that lady there — the one who is sitting on the settee , the one who has just been escorted to the verandah by a crowd of lacqueys . Behind her see that pile of luggage ! She must have arrived by train . ” “ But why should she be calling ME ? Hear her calling again ! See ! She is beckoning to us ! ” “ Yes , so she is , ” assented Mr. Astley . “ Alexis Ivanovitch , Alexis Ivanovitch ! Good heavens , what a stupid fellow ! ” came in a despairing wail from the verandah . We had almost reached the portico , and I was just setting foot upon the space before it , when my hands fell to my sides in limp astonishment , and my feet glued themselves to the pavement ! For on the topmost tier of the hotel verandah , after being carried up the steps in an armchair amid a bevy of footmen , maid-servants , and other menials of the hotel , headed by the landlord ( that functionary had actually run out to meet a visitor who arrived with so much stir and din , attended by her own retinue , and accompanied by so great a pile of trunks and portmanteaux ) — on the topmost tier of the verandah , I say , there was sitting — THE GRANDMOTHER ! Yes , it was she — rich , and imposing , and seventy-five years of age — Antonida Vassilievna Tarassevitcha , landowner and grande dame of Moscow — the “ La Baboulenka ” who had caused so many telegrams to be sent off and received — who had been dying , yet not dying — who had , in her own person , descended upon us even as snow might fall from the clouds ! Though unable to walk , she had arrived borne aloft in an armchair ( her mode of conveyance for the last five years ) , as brisk , aggressive , self-satisfied , bolt-upright , loudly imperious , and generally abusive as ever . In fact , she looked exactly as she had on the only two occasions when I had seen her since my appointment to the General 's household . Naturally enough , I stood petrified with astonishment . She had sighted me a hundred paces off ! Even while she was being carried along in her chair she had recognised me , and called me by name and surname ( which , as usual , after hearing once , she had remembered ever afterwards ) .",

Though she had reached her seventy-sixth year , her face was still fresh , and her teeth had not decayed . Lastly , she was dressed in a black silk gown and white mobcap .",

Meanwhile I was reflecting that probably the old lady knew all about the telegrams , and even about De Griers , though little or nothing about Mlle . Blanche . I said as much to Mr. Astley . But what a frail creature is man ! No sooner was my first surprise abated than I found myself rejoicing in the shock which we were about to administer to the General . So much did the thought inspire me that I marched ahead in the gayest of fashions . Our party was lodging on the third floor . Without knocking at the door , or in any way announcing our presence , I threw open the portals , and the Grandmother was borne through them in triumph . As though of set purpose , the whole party chanced at that moment to be assembled in the General 's study . The time was eleven o'clock , and it seemed that an outing of some sort ( at which a portion of the party were to drive in carriages , and others to ride on horseback , accompanied by one or two extraneous acquaintances ) was being planned . The General was present , and also Polina , the children , the latter 's nurses , De Griers , Mlle . Blanche ( attired in a riding-habit ) , her mother , the young Prince , and a learned German whom I beheld for the first time . Into the midst of this assembly the lacqueys conveyed Madame in her chair , and set her down within three paces of the General !",

I too have character . Turn round . Surely that is not false hair that you are wearing ? ” “ No , Grandmamma . It is my own . ” “ Well , well . I do not like the stupid fashions of today . You are very good looking . I should have fallen in love with you if I had been a man . Why do you not get married ? It is time now that I was going . I want to walk , yet I always have to ride . Are you still in a bad temper ? ” she added to the General . “ No , indeed , ” rejoined the now mollified General . “ I quite understand that at your time of life — ” “ Cette vieille est tombee en enfance , ” De Griers whispered to me . “ But I want to look round a little , ” the old lady added to the General . Will you lend me Alexis Ivanovitch for the purpose ? “ As much as you like . But I myself — yes , and Polina and Monsieur de Griers too — we all of us hope to have the pleasure of escorting you . ” “ Mais , madame , cela sera un plaisir , ” De Griers commented with a bewitching smile . “ ‘ Plaisir ’ indeed ! Why , I look upon you as a perfect fool , monsieur . ” Then she remarked to the General : “ I am not going to let you have any of my money . I must be off to my rooms now , to see what they are like . Afterwards we will look round a little . Lift me up . ” Again the Grandmother was borne aloft and carried down the staircase amid a perfect bevy of followers — the General walking as though he had been hit over the head with a cudgel , and De Griers seeming to be plunged in thought . Endeavouring to be left behind , Mlle . Blanche next thought better of it , and followed the rest , with the Prince in her wake . Only the German savant and Madame de Cominges did not leave the General 's apartments . At spas — and , probably , all over Europe — hotel landlords and managers are guided in their allotment of rooms to visitors , not so much by the wishes and requirements of those visitors , as by their personal estimate of the same . It may also be said that these landlords and managers seldom make a mistake . To the Grandmother , however , our landlord , for some reason or another , allotted such a sumptuous suite that he fairly overreached himself ; for he assigned her a suite consisting of four magnificently appointed rooms , with bathroom , servants ’ quarters , a separate room for her maid , and so on . In fact , during the previous week the suite had been occupied by no less a personage than a Grand Duchess : which circumstance was duly explained to the new occupant , as an excuse for raising the price of these apartments . The Grandmother had herself carried — or , rather , wheeled — through each room in turn , in order that she might subject the whole to a close and attentive scrutiny ; while the landlord — an elderly , bald-headed man — walked respectfully by her side .",

Surely you are wrong ? Monsieur , monsieur — ” here she nudged the croupier who was sitting on her left , and preparing to spin — “ combien zero ? Douze ? Douze ? ” I hastened to translate . “ Oui , Madame , ” was the croupier 's polite reply . “ No single stake must exceed four thousand florins . That is the regulation . ” “ Then there is nothing else for it . We must risk in gulden . ” “ Le jeu est fait ! ” the croupier called . The wheel revolved , and stopped at thirty . We had lost ! “ Again , again , again ! Stake again ! ” shouted the old lady . Without attempting to oppose her further , but merely shrugging my shoulders , I placed twelve more ten-gulden pieces upon the table . The wheel whirled around and around , with the Grandmother simply quaking as she watched its revolutions . “ Does she again think that zero is going to be the winning coup ? ” thought I , as I stared at her in astonishment . Yet an absolute assurance of winning was shining on her face ; she looked perfectly convinced that zero was about to be called again . At length the ball dropped off into one of the notches . “ Zero ! ” cried the croupier . “ Ah !!! ” screamed the old lady as she turned to me in a whirl of triumph . I myself was at heart a gambler . At that moment I became acutely conscious both of that fact and of the fact that my hands and knees were shaking , and that the blood was beating in my brain . Of course this was a rare occasion — an occasion on which zero had turned up no less than three times within a dozen rounds ; yet in such an event there was nothing so very surprising , seeing that , only three days ago , I myself had been a witness to zero turning up THREE TIMES IN SUCCESSION , so that one of the players who was recording the coups on paper was moved to remark that for several days past zero had never turned up at all !",

Though not outwardly shaken by the event ( indeed , she seemed perfectly calm ) , she was trembling inwardly from head to foot . At length , completely absorbed in the game , she burst out : “ Alexis Ivanovitch , did not the croupier just say that 4000 florins were the most that could be staked at any one time ? Well , take these 4000 , and stake them upon the red . ” To oppose her was useless . Once more the wheel revolved . “ Rouge ! ” proclaimed the croupier . Again 4000 florins — in all 8000 ! “ Give me them , ” commanded the Grandmother , “ and stake the other 4000 upon the red again . ” I did so . “ Rouge ! ” proclaimed the croupier . “ Twelve thousand ! ” cried the old lady . “ Hand me the whole lot . Put the gold into this purse here , and count the bank notes . Enough ! Let us go home . Wheel my chair away . ” THE chair , with the old lady beaming in it , was wheeled away towards the doors at the further end of the salon , while our party hastened to crowd around her , and to offer her their congratulations . In fact , eccentric as was her conduct , it was also overshadowed by her triumph ; with the result that the General no longer feared to be publicly compromised by being seen with such a strange woman , but , smiling in a condescending , cheerfully familiar way , as though he were soothing a child , he offered his greetings to the old lady . At the same time , both he and the rest of the spectators were visibly impressed . Everywhere people kept pointing to the Grandmother , and talking about her . Many people even walked beside her chair , in order to view her the better while , at a little distance , Astley was carrying on a conversation on the subject with two English acquaintances of his . De Griers was simply overflowing with smiles and compliments , and a number of fine ladies were staring at the Grandmother as though she had been something curious .",

Blanche who was not only as deeply involved as the other two , but also expectant of becoming Madame General and an important legatee — would not lightly surrender the position , but would use her every resource of coquetry upon the old lady , in order to afford a contrast to the impetuous Polina , who was difficult to understand , and lacked the art of pleasing . Yet now , when the Grandmother had just performed an astonishing feat at roulette ; now , when the old lady 's personality had been so clearly and typically revealed as that of a rugged , arrogant woman who was “ tombee en enfance ” ; now , when everything appeared to be lost ,— why , now the Grandmother was as merry as a child which plays with thistle-down . “ Good Lord ! ” I thought with , may God forgive me , a most malicious smile , “ every ten-gulden piece which the Grandmother staked must have raised a blister on the General 's heart , and maddened De Griers , and driven Mlle . de Cominges almost to frenzy with the sight of this spoon dangling before her lips . ” Another factor is the circumstance that even when , overjoyed at winning , the Grandmother was distributing alms right and left , and taking every one to be a beggar , she again snapped out to the General that he was not going to be allowed any of her money — which meant that the old lady had quite made up her mind on the point , and was sure of it . Yes , danger loomed ahead . All these thoughts passed through my mind during the few moments that , having left the old lady 's rooms , I was ascending to my own room on the top storey . What most struck me was the fact that , though I had divined the chief , the stoutest , threads which united the various actors in the drama , I had , until now , been ignorant of the methods and secrets of the game . For Polina had never been completely open with me . Although , on occasions , it had happened that involuntarily , as it were , she had revealed to me something of her heart , I had noticed that in most cases — in fact , nearly always — she had either laughed away these revelations , or grown confused , or purposely imparted to them a false guise . Yes , she must have concealed a great deal from me . But , I had a presentiment that now the end of this strained and mysterious situation was approaching . Another stroke , and all would be finished and exposed . Of my own fortunes , interested though I was in the affair , I took no account . I was in the strange position of possessing but two hundred gulden , of being at a loose end , of lacking both a post , the means of subsistence , a shred of hope , and any plans for the future , yet of caring nothing for these things . Had not my mind been so full of Polina , I should have given myself up to the comical piquancy of the impending denouement , and laughed my fill at it . But the thought of Polina was torture to me . That her fate was settled I already had an inkling ; yet that was not the thought which was giving me so much uneasiness . What I really wished for was to penetrate her secrets . I wanted her to come to me and say , “ I love you , ” and , if she would not so come , or if to hope that she would ever do so was an unthinkable absurdity — why , then there was nothing else for me to want . Even now I do not know what I am wanting . I feel like a man who has lost his way . I yearn but to be in her presence , and within the circle of her light and splendour — to be there now , and forever , and for the whole of my life . More I do not know . How can I ever bring myself to leave her ?",

I yearn but to be in her presence , and within the circle of her light and splendour — to be there now , and forever , and for the whole of my life . More I do not know . How can I ever bring myself to leave her ? On reaching the third storey of the hotel I experienced a shock . I was just passing the General 's suite when something caused me to look round . Out of a door about twenty paces away there was coming Polina ! She hesitated for a moment on seeing me , and then beckoned me to her . “ Polina Alexandrovna ! ” “ Hush !

But she had vanished again . Aha ! So the two were carrying on a correspondence ! However , I set off to search for Astley — first at his hotel , and then at the Casino , where I went the round of the salons in vain .

To think that HE should be her confidant ! “ My friend , mine own familiar friend ! ” passed through my mind . Yet WAS there any love in the matter ? “ Of course not , ” reason whispered to me . But reason goes for little on such occasions . I felt that the matter must be cleared up , for it was becoming unpleasantly complex .",

        "context": "All these thoughts passed through my mind during the few moments that , having left the old lady 's rooms , I was ascending to my own room on the top storey . What most struck me was the fact that , though I had divined the chief , the stoutest , threads which united the various actors in the drama , I had , until now , been ignorant of the methods and secrets of the game . For Polina had never been completely open with me . Although , on occasions , it had happened that involuntarily , as it were , she had revealed to me something of her heart , I had noticed that in most cases — in fact , nearly always — she had either laughed away these revelations , or grown confused , or purposely imparted to them a false guise . Yes , she must have concealed a great deal from me . But , I had a presentiment that now the end of this strained and mysterious situation was approaching . Another stroke , and all would be finished and exposed . Of my own fortunes , interested though I was in the affair , I took no account . I was in the strange position of possessing but two hundred gulden , of being at a loose end , of lacking both a post , the means of subsistence , a shred of hope , and any plans for the future , yet of caring nothing for these things . Had not my mind been so full of Polina , I should have given myself up to the comical piquancy of the impending denouement , and laughed my fill at it . But the thought of Polina was torture to me . That her fate was settled I already had an inkling ; yet that was not the thought which was giving me so much uneasiness . What I really wished for was to penetrate her secrets .

        "context": "Some very heated discussion was in progress , and meanwhile the door of the study was open — an unprecedented circumstance . As I approached the portals I could hear loud voices raised , for mingled with the pert , venomous accents of De Griers were Mlle . Blanche 's excited , impudently abusive tongue and the General 's plaintive wail as , apparently , he sought to justify himself in something . But on my appearance every one stopped speaking , and tried to put a better face upon matters . De Griers smoothed his hair , and twisted his angry face into a smile — into the mean , studiedly polite French smile which I so detested ; while the downcast , perplexed General assumed an air of dignity — though only in a mechanical way . On the other hand , Mlle . Blanche did not trouble to conceal the wrath that was sparkling in her countenance , but bent her gaze upon me with an air of impatient expectancy . I may remark that hitherto she had treated me with absolute superciliousness , and , so far from answering my salutations , had always ignored them . “ Alexis Ivanovitch , ” began the General in a tone of affectionate upbraiding , “ may I say to you that I find it strange , exceedingly strange , that — In short , your conduct towards myself and my family — In a word , your — er — extremely — ” “ Eh ! Ce n'est pas ca , ” interrupted De Griers in a tone of impatience and contempt ( evidently he was the ruling spirit of the conclave ) . “ Mon cher monsieur , notre general se trompe . What he means to say is that he warns you — he begs of you most earnestly — not to ruin him . I use the expression because — ” “ Why ? Why ? ” I interjected . “ Because you have taken upon yourself to act as guide to this , to this — how shall I express it ?— to this old lady , a cette pauvre terrible vieille . But she will only gamble away all that she has — gamble it away like thistledown . You yourself have seen her play . Once she has acquired the taste for gambling , she will never leave the roulette-table , but , of sheer perversity and temper , will stake her all , and lose it . In cases such as hers a gambler can never be torn away from the game ; and then — and then — ” “ And then , ” asseverated the General , “ you will have ruined my whole family . I and my family are her heirs , for she has no nearer relatives than ourselves . I tell you frankly that my affairs are in great — very great disorder ; how much they are so you yourself are partially aware . If she should lose a large sum , or , maybe , her whole fortune , what will become of us — of my children ” ( here the General exchanged a glance with De Griers ) “ or of me ? ” ( here he looked at Mlle . Blanche , who turned her head contemptuously away ) . “ Alexis Ivanovitch , I beg of you to save us . ” “ Tell me , General , how am I to do so ? On what footing do I stand here ? ” “ Refuse to take her about . Simply leave her alone . ” “ But she would soon find some one else to take my place ? ” “ Ce n'est pas ca , ce n'est pas ca , ” again interrupted De Griers . “ Que diable ! Do not leave her alone so much as advise her , persuade her , draw her away . In any case do not let her gamble ; find her some counter-attraction . ”",

Alexis Ivanovitch , tell him that we can easily repair to someone else . ” “ The clerk says that others will give you even less than he . ” Of what the ultimate calculations consisted I do not exactly remember , but at all events they were alarming . Receiving twelve thousand florins in gold , I took also the statement of accounts , and carried it out to the Grandmother . “ Well , well , ” she said , “ I am no accountant . Let us hurry away , hurry away . ” And she waved the paper aside . “ Neither upon that accursed zero , however , nor upon that equally accursed red do I mean to stake a cent , ” I muttered to myself as I entered the Casino . This time I did all I could to persuade the old lady to stake as little as possible — saying that a turn would come in the chances when she would be at liberty to stake more . But she was so impatient that , though at first she agreed to do as I suggested , nothing could stop her when once she had begun . By way of prelude she won stakes of a hundred and two hundred gulden . “ There you are ! ” she said as she nudged me . “ See what we have won ! Surely it would be worth our while to stake four thousand instead of a hundred , for we might win another four thousand , and then —! Oh , it was YOUR fault before — all your fault ! ” I felt greatly put out as I watched her play , but I decided to hold my tongue , and to give her no more advice . Suddenly De Griers appeared on the scene . It seemed that all this while he and his companions had been standing beside us — though I noticed that Mlle . Blanche had withdrawn a little from the rest , and was engaged in flirting with the Prince . Clearly the General was greatly put out at this . Indeed , he was in a perfect agony of vexation . But Mlle . was careful never to look his way , though he did his best to attract her notice . Poor General ! By turns his face blanched and reddened , and he was trembling to such an extent that he could scarcely follow the old lady 's play . At length Mlle . and the Prince took their departure , and the General followed them . “ Madame , Madame , ” sounded the honeyed accents of De Griers as he leant over to whisper in the Grandmother 's ear . “ That stake will never win . No , no , it is impossible , ” he added in Russian with a writhe . “ No , no ! ” “ But why not ? ” asked the Grandmother , turning round . “ Show me what I ought to do . ”",

        "context": "Meanwhile , that day some other very important events were passing in our hotel . As early as eleven o'clock — that is to say , before the Grandmother had quitted her rooms — the General and De Griers decided upon their last stroke . In other words , on learning that the old lady had changed her mind about departing , and was bent on setting out for the Casino again , the whole of our gang ( Polina only excepted ) proceeded en masse to her rooms , for the purpose of finally and frankly treating with her . But the General , quaking and greatly apprehensive as to his possible future , overdid things . After half an hour 's prayers and entreaties , coupled with a full confession of his debts , and even of his passion for Mlle . Blanche ( yes , he had quite lost his head ) , he suddenly adopted a tone of menace , and started to rage at the old lady — exclaiming that she was sullying the family honour , that she was making a public scandal of herself , and that she was smirching the fair name of Russia . The upshot was that the Grandmother turned him out of the room with her stick ( it was a real stick , too ! ) . Later in the morning he held several consultations with De Griers — the question which occupied him being : Is it in any way possible to make use of the police — to tell them that “ this respected , but unfortunate , old lady has gone out of her mind , and is squandering her last kopeck , ” or something of the kind ? In short , is it in any way possible to engineer a species of supervision over , or of restraint upon , the old lady ? De Griers , however , shrugged his shoulders at this , and laughed in the General 's face , while the old warrior went on chattering volubly , and running up and down his study . Finally De Griers waved his hand , and disappeared from view ; and by evening it became known that he had left the hotel , after holding a very secret and important conference with Mlle . Blanche . As for the latter , from early morning she had taken decisive measures , by completely excluding the General from her presence , and bestowing upon him not a glance . Indeed , even when the General pursued her to the Casino , and met her walking arm in arm with the Prince , he ( the General ) received from her and her mother not the slightest recognition .

Of course , this might have been done out of sheer wantonness , for I well knew — I had remarked it only too often — that , after listening to what I had to say , and angering me almost beyond endurance , she loved suddenly to torture me with some fresh outburst of contempt and aloofness ! Yet she must have known that I could not live without her . Three days had elapsed since the affair with the Baron , and I could bear the severance no longer . When , that afternoon , I met her near the Casino , my heart almost made me faint , it beat so violently . She too could not live without me , for had she not said that she had NEED of me ? Or had that too been spoken in jest ? That she had a secret of some kind there could be no doubt . What she had said to the Grandmother had stabbed me to the heart . On a thousand occasions I had challenged her to be open with me , nor could she have been ignorant that I was ready to give my very life for her . Yet always she had kept me at a distance with that contemptuous air of hers ; or else she had demanded of me , in lieu of the life which I offered to lay at her feet , such escapades as I had perpetrated with the Baron . Ah , was it not torture to me , all this ? For could it be that her whole world was bound up with the Frenchman ? What , too , about Mr. Astley ? The affair was inexplicable throughout . My God , what distress it caused me ! Arrived home , I , in a fit of frenzy , indited the following : “ Polina Alexandrovna , I can see that there is approaching us an exposure which will involve you too . For the last time I ask of you — have you , or have you not , any need of my life ? If you have , then make such dispositions as you wish , and I shall always be discoverable in my room if required . If you have need of my life , write or send for me . ” I sealed the letter , and dispatched it by the hand of a corridor lacquey , with orders to hand it to the addressee in person . Though I expected no answer , scarcely three minutes had elapsed before the lacquey returned with “ the compliments of a certain person . ” Next , about seven o'clock , I was sent for by the General . I found him in his study , apparently preparing to go out again , for his hat and stick were lying on the sofa . When I entered he was standing in the middle of the room — his feet wide apart , and his head bent down . Also , he appeared to be talking to himself . But as soon as ever he saw me at the door he came towards me in such a curious manner that involuntarily I retreated a step , and was for leaving the room ; whereupon he seized me by both hands , and , drawing me towards the sofa , and seating himself thereon , he forced me to sit down on a chair opposite him . Then , without letting go of my hands , he exclaimed with quivering lips and a sparkle of tears on his eyelashes :",

Though I expected no answer , scarcely three minutes had elapsed before the lacquey returned with “ the compliments of a certain person . ” Next , about seven o'clock , I was sent for by the General . I found him in his study , apparently preparing to go out again , for his hat and stick were lying on the sofa .

Then , without letting go of my hands , he exclaimed with quivering lips and a sparkle of tears on his eyelashes : “ Oh , Alexis Ivanovitch ! Save me , save me ! Have some mercy upon me ! ” For a long time I could not make out what he meant , although he kept talking and talking , and constantly repeating to himself , “ Have mercy , mercy ! ” At length , however , I divined that he was expecting me to give him something in the nature of advice — or , rather , that , deserted by every one , and overwhelmed with grief and apprehension , he had bethought himself of my existence , and sent for me to relieve his feelings by talking and talking and talking . In fact , he was in such a confused and despondent state of mind that , clasping his hands together , he actually went down upon his knees and begged me to go to Mlle . Blanche , and beseech and advise her to return to him , and to accept him in marriage . “ But , General , ” I exclaimed , “ possibly Mlle . Blanche has scarcely even remarked my existence ?

Blanche — laughing gaily at one another !— while beside them , on the sofa , there was seated her mother . Clearly the General was almost out of his mind with joy , for he was talking all sorts of nonsense , and bubbling over with a long-drawn , nervous laugh — a laugh which twisted his face into innumerable wrinkles , and caused his eyes almost to disappear . Afterwards I learnt from Mlle . Blanche herself that , after dismissing the Prince and hearing of the General 's tears , she bethought her of going to comfort the old man , and had just arrived for the purpose when I entered . Fortunately , the poor General did not know that his fate had been decided — that Mlle . had long ago packed her trunks in readiness for the first morning train to Paris ! Hesitating a moment on the threshold I changed my mind as to entering , and departed unnoticed . Ascending to my own room , and opening the door , I perceived in the semi-darkness a figure seated on a chair in the corner by the window . The figure did not rise when I entered , so I approached it swiftly , peered at it closely , and felt my heart almost stop beating . The figure was Polina ! “ What is the matter ? What is the matter ? ” she asked in a strange voice . She was looking pale , and her eyes were dim .",

After that I do not exactly remember either my calculations or the order of my stakings . I only remember that , as in a dream , I won in one round sixteen thousand florins ; that in the three following rounds , I lost twelve thousand ; that I moved the remainder ( four thousand ) on to “ Passe ” ( though quite unconscious of what I was doing — I was merely waiting , as it were , mechanically , and without reflection , for something ) and won ; and that , finally , four times in succession I lost . Yes , I can remember raking in money by thousands — but most frequently on the twelve , middle numbers , to which I constantly adhered , and which kept appearing in a sort of regular order — first , three or four times running , and then , after an interval of a couple of rounds , in another break of three or four appearances . Sometimes , this astonishing regularity manifested itself in patches ; a thing to upset all the calculations of note — taking gamblers who play with a pencil and a memorandum book in their hands Fortune perpetrates some terrible jests at roulette !",

        "context": "But I did not heed them . The Avenue was so dark that it was barely possible to distinguish one 's hand before one 's face , while the distance to the hotel was half a verst or so ; but I feared neither pickpockets nor highwaymen . Indeed , never since my boyhood have I done that . Also , I cannot remember what I thought about on the way . I only felt a sort of fearful pleasure — the pleasure of success , of conquest , of power ( how can I best express it ? ) . Likewise , before me there flitted the image of Polina ; and I kept remembering , and reminding myself , that it was to HER I was going , that it was in HER presence I should soon be standing , that it was SHE to whom I should soon be able to relate and show everything . Scarcely once did I recall what she had lately said to me , or the reason why I had left her , or all those varied sensations which I had been experiencing a bare hour and a half ago . No , those sensations seemed to be things of the past , to be things which had righted themselves and grown old , to be things concerning which we needed to trouble ourselves no longer , since , for us , life was about to begin anew . Yet I had just reached the end of the Avenue when there DID come upon me a fear of being robbed or murdered . With each step the fear increased until , in my terror , I almost started to run . Suddenly , as I issued from the Avenue , there burst upon me the lights of the hotel , sparkling with a myriad lamps ! Yes , thanks be to God , I had reached home ! Running up to my room , I flung open the door of it . Polina was still on the sofa , with a lighted candle in front of her , and her hands clasped . As I entered she stared at me in astonishment ( for , at the moment , I must have presented a strange spectacle ) . All I did , however , was to halt before her , and fling upon the table my burden of wealth . I remember , too , how , without moving from her place , or changing her attitude , she gazed into my face . “ I have won two hundred thousand francs ! ” cried I as I pulled out my last sheaf of bank-notes . The pile of paper currency occupied the whole table . I could not withdraw my eyes from it . Consequently , for a moment or two Polina escaped my mind . Then I set myself to arrange the pile in order , and to sort the notes , and to mass the gold in a separate heap . That done , I left everything where it lay , and proceeded to pace the room with rapid strides as I lost myself in thought . Then I darted to the table once more , and began to recount the money ; until all of a sudden , as though I had remembered something , I rushed to the door , and closed and double-locked it . Finally I came to a meditative halt before my little trunk . “ Shall I put the money there until tomorrow ? ” I asked , turning sharply round to Polina as the recollection of her returned to me . She was still in her old place — still making not a sound . Yet her eyes had followed every one of my movements . Somehow in her face there was a strange expression — an expression which I did not like . I think that I shall not be wrong if I say that it indicated sheer hatred . Impulsively I approached her . “ Polina , ” I said , “ here are twenty-five thousand florins — fifty thousand francs , or more . Take them , and tomorrow throw them in De Griers ’ face . ” She returned no answer . “ Or , if you should prefer , ” I continued , “ let me take them to him myself tomorrow — yes , early tomorrow morning . Shall I ? ” Then all at once she burst out laughing , and laughed for a long while . With astonishment and a feeling of offence I gazed at her . Her laughter was too like the derisive merriment which she had so often indulged in of late — merriment which had broken forth always at the time of my most passionate explanations . At length she ceased , and frowned at me from under her eyebrows .",

Take them , and tomorrow throw them in De Griers ’ face . ” She returned no answer . “ Or , if you should prefer , ” I continued , “ let me take them to him myself tomorrow — yes , early tomorrow morning . Shall I ? ” Then all at once she burst out laughing , and laughed for a long while . With astonishment and a feeling of offence I gazed at her . Her laughter was too like the derisive merriment which she had so often indulged in of late — merriment which had broken forth always at the time of my most passionate explanations . At length she ceased , and frowned at me from under her eyebrows . “ I am NOT going to take your money , ” she said contemptuously . “ Why not ? ” I cried . “ Why not , Polina ? ” “ Because I am not in the habit of receiving money for nothing . ” “ But I am offering it to you as a FRIEND in the same way I would offer you my very life . ” Upon this she threw me a long , questioning glance , as though she were seeking to probe me to the depths . “ You are giving too much for me , ” she remarked with a smile . “ The beloved of De Griers is not worth fifty thousand francs . ”",

Ah , but this was THE PRESENT . What about the future ? Her delirium and sickness were not likely to make her forget what she had done in bringing me De Griers ’ letter . No , she must have known what she was doing when she brought it . Somehow I contrived to stuff the pile of notes and gold under the bed , to cover them over , and then to leave the room some ten minutes after Polina . I felt sure that she had returned to her own room ; wherefore , I intended quietly to follow her , and to ask the nursemaid aid who opened the door how her mistress was . Judge , therefore , of my surprise when , meeting the domestic on the stairs , she informed me that Polina had not yet returned , and that she ( the domestic ) was at that moment on her way to my room in quest of her ! “ Mlle . left me but ten minutes ago , ” I said . “ What can have become of her ? ” The nursemaid looked at me reproachfully . Already sundry rumours were flying about the hotel . Both in the office of the commissionaire and in that of the landlord it was whispered that , at seven o'clock that morning , the Fraulein had left the hotel , and set off , despite the rain , in the direction of the Hotel d'Angleterre . From words and hints let fall I could see that the fact of Polina having spent the night in my room was now public property . Also , sundry rumours were circulating concerning the General 's family affairs . It was known that last night he had gone out of his mind , and paraded the hotel in tears ; also , that the old lady who had arrived was his mother , and that she had come from Russia on purpose to forbid her son 's marriage with Mlle . de Cominges , as well as to cut him out of her will if he should disobey her ; also that , because he had disobeyed her , she had squandered all her money at roulette , in order to have nothing more to leave to him . “ Oh , these Russians ! ” exclaimed the landlord , with an angry toss of the head , while the bystanders laughed and the clerk betook himself to his accounts . Also , every one had learnt about my winnings ; Karl , the corridor lacquey , was the first to congratulate me . But with these folk I had nothing to do . My business was to set off at full speed to the Hotel d'Angleterre .",

        "context": "At that moment she cannot have been in her right mind ; yet , what was the cause of her temporary aberration I cannot say . For a month past she had been unwell . Yet what had brought about this PRESENT condition of mind , above all things , this outburst ? Had it come of wounded pride ? Had it come of despair over her decision to come to me ? Had it come of the fact that , presuming too much on my good fortune , I had seemed to be intending to desert her ( even as De Griers had done ) when once I had given her the fifty thousand francs ? But , on my honour , I had never cherished any such intention . What was at fault , I think , was her own pride , which kept urging her not to trust me , but , rather , to insult me — even though she had not realised the fact . In her eyes I corresponded to De Griers , and therefore had been condemned for a fault not wholly my own . Her mood of late had been a sort of delirium , a sort of light-headedness — that I knew full well ; yet , never had I sufficiently taken it into consideration . Perhaps she would not pardon me now ? Ah , but this was THE PRESENT . What about the future ? Her delirium and sickness were not likely to make her forget what she had done in bringing me De Griers ’ letter . No , she must have known what she was doing when she brought it . Somehow I contrived to stuff the pile of notes and gold under the bed , to cover them over , and then to leave the room some ten minutes after Polina . I felt sure that she had returned to her own room ; wherefore , I intended quietly to follow her , and to ask the nursemaid aid who opened the door how her mistress was . Judge , therefore , of my surprise when , meeting the domestic on the stairs , she informed me that Polina had not yet returned , and that she ( the domestic ) was at that moment on her way to my room in quest of her ! “ Mlle . left me but ten minutes ago , ” I said . “ What can have become of her ? ” The nursemaid looked at me reproachfully . Already sundry rumours were flying about the hotel . Both in the office of the commissionaire and in that of the landlord it was whispered that , at seven o'clock that morning , the Fraulein had left the hotel , and set off , despite the rain , in the direction of the Hotel d'Angleterre . From words and hints let fall I could see that the fact of Polina having spent the night in my room was now public property . Also , sundry rumours were circulating concerning the General 's family affairs . It was known that last night he had gone out of his mind , and paraded the hotel in tears ; also , that the old lady who had arrived was his mother , and that she had come from Russia on purpose to forbid her son 's marriage with Mlle . de Cominges , as well as to cut him out of her will if he should disobey her ; also that , because he had disobeyed her , she had squandered all her money at roulette , in order to have nothing more to leave to him . “ Oh , these Russians ! ” exclaimed the landlord , with an angry toss of the head , while the bystanders laughed and the clerk betook himself to his accounts . Also , every one had learnt about my winnings ; Karl , the corridor lacquey , was the first to congratulate me . But with these folk I had nothing to do . My business was to set off at full speed to the Hotel d'Angleterre .",

Nous ferons bombance , n'esthYpppHeNce pas ? ” Entering her room , I found her lolling under a pink satin coverlet , and revealing a pair of swarthy , wonderfully healthy shoulders — shoulders such as one sees in dreams — shoulders covered over with a white cambric nightgown which , trimmed with lace , stood out , in striking relief , against the darkness of her skin . “ Mon fils , as-tu du coeur ? ” she cried when she saw me , and then giggled . Her laugh had always been a very cheerful one , and at times it even sounded sincere . “ Tout autre — ” I began , paraphrasing Corneille . “ See here , ” she prattled on . “ Please search for my stockings , and help me to dress .

I am just off , let me tell you . ” “ This moment ? ” “ In half an hour . ” True enough , everything stood ready-packed — trunks , portmanteaux , and all .

I laughed , and started to draw on to the foot a silk stocking , while Mlle . Blanche sat on the edge of the bed and chattered . “ Eh bien , que feras-tu si je te prends avec moi ? First of all I must have fifty thousand francs , and you shall give them to me at Frankfurt . Then we will go on to Paris , where we will live together , et je te ferai voir des etoiles en plein jour . Yes , you shall see such women as your eyes have never lit upon . ” “ Stop a moment . If I were to give you those fifty thousand francs , what should I have left for myself ? ” “ Another hundred thousand francs , please to remember . Besides , I could live with you in your rooms for a month , or even for two ; or even for longer . But it would not take us more than two months to get through fifty thousand francs ; for , look you , je suis bonne enfante , et tu verras des etoiles , you may be sure . ”",

The truth is that he had never counted upon this programme when he came to Paris to seek us out . On that occasion he had made his appearance nearly shaking with terror , for he had supposed that Blanche would at once raise an outcry , and have him put from the door ; wherefore , he was the more enraptured at the turn that things had taken , and spent the month in a state of senseless ecstasy . Already I had learnt that , after our unexpected departure from Roulettenberg , he had had a sort of a fit — that he had fallen into a swoon , and spent a week in a species of garrulous delirium .

Of course Blanche 's reception of him had acted as the best of all possible cures , but for long enough he carried the marks of his affliction , despite his present condition of rapture and delight . To think clearly , or even to engage in any serious conversation , had now become impossible for him ; he could only ejaculate after each word “ Hm ! ” and then nod his head in confirmation .

To all this I would say nothing , however much she chattered on ; until at length I would burst out laughing , and the incident would come to an end ( at first , as I have said , she had thought me a fool , but since she had come to deem me a man of sense and sensibility ) . In short , I had the happiness of calling her better nature into play ; for though , at first , I had not deemed her so , she was , in reality , a kind-hearted woman after her own fashion . “ You are good and clever , ” she said to me towards the finish , “ and my one regret is that you are also so wrong-headed . You will NEVER be a rich man ! ” “ Un vrai Russe — un Kalmuk ” she usually called me . Several times she sent me to give the General an airing in the streets , even as she might have done with a lacquey and her spaniel ; but , I preferred to take him to the theatre , to the Bal Mabille , and to restaurants . For this purpose she usually allowed me some money , though the General had a little of his own , and enjoyed taking out his purse before strangers . Once I had to use actual force to prevent him from buying a phaeton at a price of seven hundred francs , after a vehicle had caught his fancy in the Palais Royal as seeming to be a desirable present for Blanche . What could SHE have done with a seven-hundred-franc phaeton ?— and the General possessed in the world but a thousand francs ! The origin even of those francs I could never determine , but imagined them to have emanated from Mr. Astley — the more so since the latter had paid the family 's hotel bill . As for what view the General took of myself , I think that he never divined the footing on which I stood with Blanche . True , he had heard , in a dim sort of way , that I had won a good deal of money ; but more probably he supposed me to be acting as secretary — or even as a kind of servant — to his inamorata . At all events , he continued to address me , in his old haughty style , as my superior . At times he even took it upon himself to scold me . One morning in particular , he started to sneer at me over our matutinal coffee . Though not a man prone to take offence , he suddenly , and for some reason of which to this day I am ignorant , fell out with me . Of course even he himself did not know the reason . To put things shortly , he began a speech which had neither beginning nor ending , and cried out , a batons rompus , that I was a boy whom he would soon put to rights — and so forth , and so forth . Yet no one could understand what he was saying , and at length Blanche exploded in a burst of laughter . Finally something appeased him , and he was taken out for his walk . More than once , however , I noticed that his depression was growing upon him ; that he seemed to be feeling the want of somebody or something ; that , despite Blanche 's presence , he was missing some person in particular . Twice , on these occasions , did he plunge into a conversation with me , though he could not make himself intelligible , and only went on rambling about the service , his late wife , his home , and his property . Every now and then , also , some particular word would please him ; whereupon he would repeat it a hundred times in the day — even though the word happened to express neither his thoughts nor his feelings . Again , I would try to get him to talk about his children , but always he cut me short in his old snappish way , and passed to another subject . “ Yes , yes — my children , ” was all that I could extract from him . “ Yes , you are right in what you have said about them . ” Only once did he disclose his real feelings . That was when we were taking him to the theatre , and suddenly he exclaimed : “ My unfortunate children ! Yes , sir , they are unfortunate children . ” Once , too , when I chanced to mention Polina , he grew quite bitter against her . “ She is an ungrateful woman ! ” he exclaimed . “ She is a bad and ungrateful woman ! She has broken up a family . If there were laws here , I would have her impaled . Yes , I would . ” As for De Griers , the General would not have his name mentioned . “ He has ruined me , ” he would say . “ He has robbed me , and cut my throat . For two years he was a perfect nightmare to me . For months at a time he never left me in my dreams . Do not speak of him again . ”",

        "context": "It happened thus : A week after we had taken up our abode in Paris there arrived thither the General . He came straight to see us , and thenceforward lived with us practically as our guest , though he had a flat of his own as well . Blanche met him with merry badinage and laughter , and even threw her arms around him . In fact , she managed it so that he had to follow everywhere in her train — whether when promenading on the Boulevards , or when driving , or when going to the theatre , or when paying calls ; and this use which she made of him quite satisfied the General . Still of imposing appearance and presence , as well as of fair height , he had a dyed moustache and whiskers ( he had formerly been in the cuirassiers ) , and a handsome , though a somewhat wrinkled , face . Also , his manners were excellent , and he could carry a frockcoat well — the more so since , in Paris , he took to wearing his orders . To promenade the Boulevards with such a man was not only a thing possible , but also , so to speak , a thing advisable , and with this programme the good but foolish General had not a fault to find . The truth is that he had never counted upon this programme when he came to Paris to seek us out . On that occasion he had made his appearance nearly shaking with terror , for he had supposed that Blanche would at once raise an outcry , and have him put from the door ; wherefore , he was the more enraptured at the turn that things had taken , and spent the month in a state of senseless ecstasy . Already I had learnt that , after our unexpected departure from Roulettenberg , he had had a sort of a fit — that he had fallen into a swoon , and spent a week in a species of garrulous delirium . Doctors had been summoned to him , but he had broken away from them , and suddenly taken a train to Paris . Of course Blanche 's reception of him had acted as the best of all possible cures , but for long enough he carried the marks of his affliction , despite his present condition of rapture and delight . To think clearly , or even to engage in any serious conversation , had now become impossible for him ; he could only ejaculate after each word “ Hm ! ” and then nod his head in confirmation . Sometimes , also , he would laugh , but only in a nervous , hysterical sort of a fashion ; while at other times he would sit for hours looking as black as night , with his heavy eyebrows knitted . Of much that went on he remained wholly oblivious , for he grew extremely absent-minded , and took to talking to himself . Only Blanche could awake him to any semblance of life . His fits of depression and moodiness in corners always meant either that he had not seen her for some while , or that she had gone out without taking him with her , or that she had omitted to caress him before departing . When in this condition , he would refuse to say what he wanted — nor had he the least idea that he was thus sulking and moping . Next , after remaining in this condition for an hour or two ( this I remarked on two occasions when Blanche had gone out for the day — probably to see Albert ) , he would begin to look about him , and to grow uneasy , and to hurry about with an air as though he had suddenly remembered something , and must try and find it ; after which , not perceiving the object of his search , nor succeeding in recalling what that object had been , he would as suddenly relapse into oblivion , and continue so until the reappearance of Blanche — merry , wanton , half-dressed , and laughing her strident laugh as she approached to pet him , and even to kiss him ( though the latter reward he seldom received ) . Once , he was so overjoyed at her doing so that he burst into tears . Even I myself was surprised . From the first moment of his arrival in Paris , Blanche set herself to plead with me on his behalf ; and at such times she even rose to heights of eloquence — saying that it was for ME she had abandoned him , though she had almost become his betrothed and promised to become so ; that it was for HER sake he had deserted his family ; that , having been in his service , I ought to remember the fact , and to feel ashamed . To all this I would say nothing , however much she chattered on ; until at length I would burst out laughing , and the incident would come to an end ( at first , as I have said , she had thought me a fool , but since she had come to deem me a man of sense and sensibility ) .

        "context": "Several times she sent me to give the General an airing in the streets , even as she might have done with a lacquey and her spaniel ; but , I preferred to take him to the theatre , to the Bal Mabille , and to restaurants . For this purpose she usually allowed me some money , though the General had a little of his own , and enjoyed taking out his purse before strangers . Once I had to use actual force to prevent him from buying a phaeton at a price of seven hundred francs , after a vehicle had caught his fancy in the Palais Royal as seeming to be a desirable present for Blanche . What could SHE have done with a seven-hundred-franc phaeton ?— and the General possessed in the world but a thousand francs ! The origin even of those francs I could never determine , but imagined them to have emanated from Mr. Astley — the more so since the latter had paid the family 's hotel bill . As for what view the General took of myself , I think that he never divined the footing on which I stood with Blanche . True , he had heard , in a dim sort of way , that I had won a good deal of money ; but more probably he supposed me to be acting as secretary — or even as a kind of servant — to his inamorata . At all events , he continued to address me , in his old haughty style , as my superior . At times he even took it upon himself to scold me . One morning in particular , he started to sneer at me over our matutinal coffee . Though not a man prone to take offence , he suddenly , and for some reason of which to this day I am ignorant , fell out with me . Of course even he himself did not know the reason . To put things shortly , he began a speech which had neither beginning nor ending , and cried out , a batons rompus , that I was a boy whom he would soon put to rights — and so forth , and so forth . Yet no one could understand what he was saying , and at length Blanche exploded in a burst of laughter . Finally something appeased him , and he was taken out for his walk . More than once , however , I noticed that his depression was growing upon him ; that he seemed to be feeling the want of somebody or something ; that , despite Blanche 's presence , he was missing some person in particular . Twice , on these occasions , did he plunge into a conversation with me , though he could not make himself intelligible , and only went on rambling about the service , his late wife , his home , and his property . Every now and then , also , some particular word would please him ; whereupon he would repeat it a hundred times in the day — even though the word happened to express neither his thoughts nor his feelings . Again , I would try to get him to talk about his children , but always he cut me short in his old snappish way , and passed to another subject . “ Yes , yes — my children , ” was all that I could extract from him . “ Yes , you are right in what you have said about them . ” Only once did he disclose his real feelings . That was when we were taking him to the theatre , and suddenly he exclaimed : “ My unfortunate children ! Yes , sir , they are unfortunate children . ” Once , too , when I chanced to mention Polina , he grew quite bitter against her . “ She is an ungrateful woman ! ” he exclaimed . “ She is a bad and ungrateful woman ! She has broken up a family . If there were laws here , I would have her impaled . Yes , I would . ” As for De Griers , the General would not have his name mentioned . “ He has ruined me , ” he would say . “ He has robbed me , and cut my throat . For two years he was a perfect nightmare to me . For months at a time he never left me in my dreams . Do not speak of him again . ” It was now clear to me that Blanche and he were on the point of coming to terms ; yet , true to my usual custom , I said nothing . At length , Blanche took the initiative in explaining matters . She did so a week before we parted . “ Il a du chance , ” she prattled , “ for the Grandmother is now REALLY ill , and therefore , bound to die . Mr. Astley has just sent a telegram to say so , and you will agree with me that the General is likely to be her heir . Even if he should not be so , he will not come amiss , since , in the first place , he has his pension , and , in the second place , he will be content to live in a back room ; whereas I shall be Madame General , and get into a good circle of society ” ( she was always thinking of this ) “ and become a Russian chatelaine . Yes , I shall have a mansion of my own , and peasants , and a million of money at my back . ” “ But , suppose he should prove jealous ? He might demand all sorts of things , you know . Do you follow me ? ” “ Oh , dear no ! How ridiculous that would be of him ! Besides , I have taken measures to prevent it . You need not be alarmed . That is to say , I have induced him to sign notes of hand in Albert 's name . Consequently , at any time I could get him punished . Is n't he ridiculous ? ” “ Very well , then . Marry him . ” And , in truth , she did so — though the marriage was a family one only , and involved no pomp or ceremony . In fact , she invited to the nuptials none but Albert and a few other friends . Hortense , Cleopatre , and the rest she kept firmly at a distance . As for the bridegroom , he took a great interest in his new position . Blanche herself tied his tie , and Blanche herself pomaded him — with the result that , in his frockcoat and white waistcoat , he looked quite comme il faut . “ Il est , pourtant , TRES comme il faut , ” Blanche remarked when she issued from his room , as though the idea that he was “ TRES comme il faut ” had impressed even her . For myself , I had so little knowledge of the minor details of the affair , and took part in it so much as a supine spectator , that I have forgotten most of what passed on this occasion . I only remember that Blanche and the Widow figured at it , not as “ de Cominges , ” but as “ du Placet . ” Why they had hitherto been “ de Cominges ” I do not know — I only know that this entirely satisfied the General , that he liked the name “ du Placet ” even better than he had liked the name “ de Cominges . ” On the morning of the wedding , he paced the salon in his gala attire and kept repeating to himself with an air of great gravity and importance : “ Mlle . Blanche du Placet ! Mlle . Blanche du Placet , du Placet ! ” He beamed with satisfaction as he did so . Both in the church and at the wedding breakfast he remained not only pleased and contented , but even proud . She too underwent a change , for now she assumed an air of added dignity .",

Yet , had things befallen otherwise , these moralists would have been among the first ( yes , I feel persuaded of it ) to approach me with friendly jests and congratulations . Yes , they would never have turned from me as they are doing now ! A fig for all of them ! What am I ? I am zero — nothing . What shall I be tomorrow ? I may be risen from the dead , and have begun life anew . For still , I may discover the man in myself , if only my manhood has not become utterly shattered .",

        "context": "I went , I say , to Homburg , but afterwards went also to Roulettenberg , as well as to Spa and Baden ; in which latter place , for a time , I acted as valet to a certain rascal of a Privy Councillor , by name Heintze , who until lately was also my master here . Yes , for five months I lived my life with lacqueys ! That was just after I had come out of Roulettenberg prison , where I had lain for a small debt which I owed . Out of that prison I was bailed by — by whom ? By Mr. Astley ? By Polina ? I do not know . At all events , the debt was paid to the tune of two hundred thalers , and I sallied forth a free man . But what was I to do with myself ? In my dilemma I had recourse to this Heintze , who was a young scapegrace , and the sort of man who could speak and write three languages . At first I acted as his secretary , at a salary of thirty gulden a month , but afterwards I became his lacquey , for the reason that he could not afford to keep a secretary — only an unpaid servant . I had nothing else to turn to , so I remained with him , and allowed myself to become his flunkey . But by stinting myself in meat and drink I saved , during my five months of service , some seventy gulden ; and one evening , when we were at Baden , I told him that I wished to resign my post , and then hastened to betake myself to roulette . Oh , how my heart beat as I did so ! No , it was not the money that I valued — what I wanted was to make all this mob of Heintzes , hotel proprietors , and fine ladies of Baden talk about me , recount my story , wonder at me , extol my doings , and worship my winnings . True , these were childish fancies and aspirations , but who knows but that I might meet Polina , and be able to tell her everything , and see her look of surprise at the fact that I had overcome so many adverse strokes of fortune . No , I had no desire for money for its own sake , for I was perfectly well aware that I should only squander it upon some new Blanche , and spend another three weeks in Paris after buying a pair of horses which had cost sixteen thousand francs . No , I never believed myself to be a hoarder ; in fact , I knew only too well that I was a spendthrift . And already , with a sort of fear , a sort of sinking in my heart , I could hear the cries of the croupiers — “ Trente et un , rouge , impair et passe , ” “ Quarte , noir , pair et manque . ” How greedily I gazed upon the gaming-table , with its scattered louis d'or , ten-gulden pieces , and thalers ; upon the streams of gold as they issued from the croupier 's hands , and piled themselves up into heaps of gold scintillating as fire ; upon the ell — long rolls of silver lying around the croupier . Even at a distance of two rooms I could hear the chink of that money — so much so that I nearly fell into convulsions . Ah , the evening when I took those seventy gulden to the gaming table was a memorable one for me . I began by staking ten gulden upon passe . For passe I had always had a sort of predilection , yet I lost my stake upon it . This left me with sixty gulden in silver . After a moment 's thought I selected zero — beginning by staking five gulden at a time . Twice I lost , but the third round suddenly brought up the desired coup . I could almost have died with joy as I received my one hundred and seventy-five gulden . Indeed , I have been less pleased when , in former times , I have won a hundred thousand gulden . Losing no time , I staked another hundred gulden upon the red , and won ; two hundred upon the red , and won ; four hundred upon the black , and won ; eight hundred upon manque , and won . Thus , with the addition of the remainder of my original capital , I found myself possessed , within five minutes , of seventeen hundred gulden . Ah , at such moments one forgets both oneself and one 's former failures ! This I had gained by risking my very life . I had dared so to risk , and behold , again I was a member of mankind !",

Polina a personal legacy of seven thousand pounds sterling . That was about six months ago , and now Mlle . is travelling with my sister 's family — my sister having since married . Mlle .

Why do you call them so particularly a ‘ Frenchman ’ and a ‘ Russian lady ’ ? ” “ Ah , I see you are interested , Mr. Astley . But it is a long , long story , and calls for a lengthy preface . At the same time , the question is an important one , however ridiculous it may seem at the first glance . A Frenchman , Mr. Astley , is merely a fine figure of a man . With this you , as a Britisher , may not agree . With it I also , as a Russian , may not agree — out of envy . Yet possibly our good ladies are of another opinion . For instance , one may look upon Racine as a broken-down , hobbledehoy , perfumed individual — one may even be unable to read him ; and I too may think him the same , as well as , in some respects , a subject for ridicule . Yet about him , Mr. Astley , there is a certain charm , and , above all things , he is a great poet — though one might like to deny it . Yes , the Frenchman , the Parisian , as a national figure , was in process of developing into a figure of elegance before we Russians had even ceased to be bears . The Revolution bequeathed to the French nobility its heritage , and now every whippersnapper of a Parisian may possess manners , methods of expression , and even thoughts that are above reproach in form , while all the time he himself may share in that form neither in initiative nor in intellect nor in soul — his manners , and the rest , having come to him through inheritance . Yes , taken by himself , the Frenchman is frequently a fool of fools and a villain of villains . Per contra , there is no one in the world more worthy of confidence and respect than this young Russian lady . De Griers might so mask his face and play a part as easily to overcome her heart , for he has an imposing figure , Mr. Astley , and this young lady might easily take that figure for his real self — for the natural form of his heart and soul — instead of the mere cloak with which heredity has dowered him . And even though it may offend you , I feel bound to say that the majority also of English people are uncouth and unrefined , whereas we Russian folk can recognise beauty wherever we see it , and are always eager to cultivate the same . But to distinguish beauty of soul and personal originality there is needed far more independence and freedom than is possessed by our women , especially by our younger ladies . At all events , they need more EXPERIENCE . For instance , this Mlle . Polina — pardon me , but the name has passed my lips , and I cannot well recall it — is taking a very long time to make up her mind to prefer you to Monsieur de Griers . She may respect you , she may become your friend , she may open out her heart to you ; yet over that heart there will be reigning that loathsome villain , that mean and petty usurer , De Griers . This will be due to obstinacy and self-love — to the fact that De Griers once appeared to her in the transfigured guise of a marquis , of a disenchanted and ruined liberal who was doing his best to help her family and the frivolous old General ; and , although these transactions of his have since been exposed , you will find that the exposure has made no impression upon her mind . Only give her the De Griers of former days , and she will ask of you no more . The more she may detest the present De Griers , the more will she lament the De Griers of the past — even though the latter never existed but in her own imagination . You are a sugar refiner , Mr. Astley , are you not ? ”",

Moreover , the question of there being anything between this Frenchman and this Russian lady is not one which you and I need discuss , nor even attempt to understand . ” “ If , ” replied Astley , “ you do not care to hear their names coupled together , may I ask you what you mean by the expressions ‘ this Frenchman , ’ ‘ this Russian lady , ’ and ‘ there being anything between them ’ ? Why do you call them so particularly a ‘ Frenchman ’ and a ‘ Russian lady ’ ? ” “ Ah , I see you are interested , Mr. Astley . But it is a long , long story , and calls for a lengthy preface . At the same time , the question is an important one , however ridiculous it may seem at the first glance . A Frenchman , Mr. Astley , is merely a fine figure of a man . With this you , as a Britisher , may not agree . With it I also , as a Russian , may not agree — out of envy . Yet possibly our good ladies are of another opinion . For instance , one may look upon Racine as a broken-down , hobbledehoy , perfumed individual — one may even be unable to read him ; and I too may think him the same , as well as , in some respects , a subject for ridicule . Yet about him , Mr. Astley , there is a certain charm , and , above all things , he is a great poet — though one might like to deny it . Yes , the Frenchman , the Parisian , as a national figure , was in process of developing into a figure of elegance before we Russians had even ceased to be bears . The Revolution bequeathed to the French nobility its heritage , and now every whippersnapper of a Parisian may possess manners , methods of expression , and even thoughts that are above reproach in form , while all the time he himself may share in that form neither in initiative nor in intellect nor in soul — his manners , and the rest , having come to him through inheritance . Yes , taken by himself , the Frenchman is frequently a fool of fools and a villain of villains . Per contra , there is no one in the world more worthy of confidence and respect than this young Russian lady . De Griers might so mask his face and play a part as easily to overcome her heart , for he has an imposing figure , Mr. Astley , and this young lady might easily take that figure for his real self — for the natural form of his heart and soul — instead of the mere cloak with which heredity has dowered him . And even though it may offend you , I feel bound to say that the majority also of English people are uncouth and unrefined , whereas we Russian folk can recognise beauty wherever we see it , and are always eager to cultivate the same . But to distinguish beauty of soul and personal originality there is needed far more independence and freedom than is possessed by our women , especially by our younger ladies . At all events , they need more EXPERIENCE . For instance , this Mlle . Polina — pardon me , but the name has passed my lips , and I cannot well recall it — is taking a very long time to make up her mind to prefer you to Monsieur de Griers . She may respect you , she may become your friend , she may open out her heart to you ; yet over that heart there will be reigning that loathsome villain , that mean and petty usurer , De Griers . This will be due to obstinacy and self-love — to the fact that De Griers once appeared to her in the transfigured guise of a marquis , of a disenchanted and ruined liberal who was doing his best to help her family and the frivolous old General ; and , although these transactions of his have since been exposed , you will find that the exposure has made no impression upon her mind . Only give her the De Griers of former days , and she will ask of you no more . The more she may detest the present De Griers , the more will she lament the De Griers of the past — even though the latter never existed but in her own imagination . You are a sugar refiner , Mr. Astley , are you not ? ”",

        "context": "“ Well , on condition that the matter shall end there , I will tell you that for a long time Mlle . Polina was ill , and still is so . My mother and sister entertained her for a while at their home in the north of England , and thereafter Mlle . Polina 's grandmother ( you remember the mad old woman ? ) died , and left Mlle . Polina a personal legacy of seven thousand pounds sterling . That was about six months ago , and now Mlle . is travelling with my sister 's family — my sister having since married . Mlle . ' s little brother and sister also benefited by the Grandmother 's will , and are now being educated in London . As for the General , he died in Paris last month , of a stroke . Mlle . Blanche did well by him , for she succeeded in having transferred to herself all that he received from the Grandmother . That , I think , concludes all that I have to tell . ” “ And De Griers ? Is he too travelling in Switzerland ? ” “ No ; nor do I know where he is . Also I warn you once more that you had better avoid such hints and ignoble suppositions ; otherwise you will assuredly have to reckon with me . ” “ What ? In spite of our old friendship ? ” “ Yes , in spite of our old friendship . ” “ Then I beg your pardon a thousand times , Mr. Astley . I meant nothing offensive to Mlle . Polina , for I have nothing of which to accuse her . Moreover , the question of there being anything between this Frenchman and this Russian lady is not one which you and I need discuss , nor even attempt to understand . ” “ If , ” replied Astley , “ you do not care to hear their names coupled together , may I ask you what you mean by the expressions ‘ this Frenchman , ’ ‘ this Russian lady , ’ and ‘ there being anything between them ’ ? Why do you call them so particularly a ‘ Frenchman ’ and a ‘ Russian lady ’ ? ” “ Ah , I see you are interested , Mr. Astley . But it is a long , long story , and calls for a lengthy preface . At the same time , the question is an important one , however ridiculous it may seem at the first glance . A Frenchman , Mr. Astley , is merely a fine figure of a man . With this you , as a Britisher , may not agree . With it I also , as a Russian , may not agree — out of envy . Yet possibly our good ladies are of another opinion . For instance , one may look upon Racine as a broken-down , hobbledehoy , perfumed individual — one may even be unable to read him ; and I too may think him the same , as well as , in some respects , a subject for ridicule . Yet about him , Mr. Astley , there is a certain charm , and , above all things , he is a great poet — though one might like to deny it . Yes , the Frenchman , the Parisian , as a national figure , was in process of developing into a figure of elegance before we Russians had even ceased to be bears . The Revolution bequeathed to the French nobility its heritage , and now every whippersnapper of a Parisian may possess manners , methods of expression , and even thoughts that are above reproach in form , while all the time he himself may share in that form neither in initiative nor in intellect nor in soul — his manners , and the rest , having come to him through inheritance . Yes , taken by himself , the Frenchman is frequently a fool of fools and a villain of villains . Per contra , there is no one in the world more worthy of confidence and respect than this young Russian lady . De Griers might so mask his face and play a part as easily to overcome her heart , for he has an imposing figure , Mr. Astley , and this young lady might easily take that figure for his real self — for the natural form of his heart and soul — instead of the mere cloak with which heredity has dowered him . And even though it may offend you , I feel bound to say that the majority also of English people are uncouth and unrefined , whereas we Russian folk can recognise beauty wherever we see it , and are always eager to cultivate the same . But to distinguish beauty of soul and personal originality there is needed far more independence and freedom than is possessed by our women , especially by our younger ladies . At all events , they need more EXPERIENCE . For instance , this Mlle . Polina — pardon me , but the name has passed my lips , and I cannot well recall it — is taking a very long time to make up her mind to prefer you to Monsieur de Griers . She may respect you , she may become your friend , she may open out her heart to you ; yet over that heart there will be reigning that loathsome villain , that mean and petty usurer , De Griers .

Even if I were also to tell you that she still loves you , you would none the less have to remain where you are . Yes , you have ruined yourself beyond redemption . Once upon a time you had a certain amount of talent , and you were of a lively disposition , and your good looks were not to be despised . You might even have been useful to your country , which needs men like you . Yet you remained here , and your life is now over . I am not blaming you for this — in my view all Russians resemble you , or are inclined to do so . If it is not roulette , then it is something else . The exceptions are very rare . Nor are you the first to learn what a taskmaster is yours . For roulette is not exclusively a Russian game . Hitherto , you have honourably preferred to serve as a lacquey rather than to act as a thief ; but what the future may have in store for you I tremble to think . Now good-bye . You are in want of money , I suppose ? Then take these ten louis d'or . More I shall not give you , for you would only gamble it away . Take care of these coins , and farewell . Once more , TAKE CARE of them . ”",

        "context": "“ Ah , I see you are interested , Mr. Astley . But it is a long , long story , and calls for a lengthy preface . At the same time , the question is an important one , however ridiculous it may seem at the first glance . A Frenchman , Mr. Astley , is merely a fine figure of a man . With this you , as a Britisher , may not agree . With it I also , as a Russian , may not agree — out of envy . Yet possibly our good ladies are of another opinion . For instance , one may look upon Racine as a broken-down , hobbledehoy , perfumed individual — one may even be unable to read him ; and I too may think him the same , as well as , in some respects , a subject for ridicule . Yet about him , Mr. Astley , there is a certain charm , and , above all things , he is a great poet — though one might like to deny it . Yes , the Frenchman , the Parisian , as a national figure , was in process of developing into a figure of elegance before we Russians had even ceased to be bears . The Revolution bequeathed to the French nobility its heritage , and now every whippersnapper of a Parisian may possess manners , methods of expression , and even thoughts that are above reproach in form , while all the time he himself may share in that form neither in initiative nor in intellect nor in soul — his manners , and the rest , having come to him through inheritance . Yes , taken by himself , the Frenchman is frequently a fool of fools and a villain of villains . Per contra , there is no one in the world more worthy of confidence and respect than this young Russian lady . De Griers might so mask his face and play a part as easily to overcome her heart , for he has an imposing figure , Mr. Astley , and this young lady might easily take that figure for his real self — for the natural form of his heart and soul — instead of the mere cloak with which heredity has dowered him . And even though it may offend you , I feel bound to say that the majority also of English people are uncouth and unrefined , whereas we Russian folk can recognise beauty wherever we see it , and are always eager to cultivate the same . But to distinguish beauty of soul and personal originality there is needed far more independence and freedom than is possessed by our women , especially by our younger ladies . At all events , they need more EXPERIENCE . For instance , this Mlle . Polina — pardon me , but the name has passed my lips , and I cannot well recall it — is taking a very long time to make up her mind to prefer you to Monsieur de Griers . She may respect you , she may become your friend , she may open out her heart to you ; yet over that heart there will be reigning that loathsome villain , that mean and petty usurer , De Griers . This will be due to obstinacy and self-love — to the fact that De Griers once appeared to her in the transfigured guise of a marquis , of a disenchanted and ruined liberal who was doing his best to help her family and the frivolous old General ; and , although these transactions of his have since been exposed , you will find that the exposure has made no impression upon her mind . Only give her the De Griers of former days , and she will ask of you no more . The more she may detest the present De Griers , the more will she lament the De Griers of the past — even though the latter never existed but in her own imagination . You are a sugar refiner , Mr. Astley , are you not ? ” “ Yes , I belong to the well-known firm of Lovell and Co . ” “ Then see here . On the one hand , you are a sugar refiner , while , on the other hand , you are an Apollo Belvedere . But the two characters do not mix with one another . I , again , am not even a sugar refiner ; I am a mere roulette gambler who has also served as a lacquey . Of this fact Mlle . Polina is probably well aware , since she appears to have an excellent force of police at her disposal . ” “ You are saying this because you are feeling bitter , ” said Astley with cold indifference . “ Yet there is not the least originality in your words . ” “ I agree .

Is that really so ? ” I cried — the tears beginning to well from my eyes . Never before had this happened . “ Yes , poor unfortunate , ” continued Astley . “ She DID love you ; and I may tell you this now for the reason that now you are utterly lost .

Even if I were also to tell you that she still loves you , you would none the less have to remain where you are . Yes , you have ruined yourself beyond redemption . Once upon a time you had a certain amount of talent , and you were of a lively disposition , and your good looks were not to be despised . You might even have been useful to your country , which needs men like you . Yet you remained here , and your life is now over . I am not blaming you for this — in my view all Russians resemble you , or are inclined to do so . If it is not roulette , then it is something else . The exceptions are very rare . Nor are you the first to learn what a taskmaster is yours . For roulette is not exclusively a Russian game . Hitherto , you have honourably preferred to serve as a lacquey rather than to act as a thief ; but what the future may have in store for you I tremble to think . Now good-bye . You are in want of money , I suppose ? Then take these ten louis d'or . More I shall not give you , for you would only gamble it away . Take care of these coins , and farewell . Once more , TAKE CARE of them . ” “ No , Mr. Astley . After all that has been said I — ” “ TAKE CARE of them ! ” repeated my friend . “ I am certain you are still a gentleman , and therefore I give you the money as one gentleman may give money to another . Also , if I could be certain that you would leave both Homburg and the gaming-tables , and return to your own country , I would give you a thousand pounds down to start life afresh ; but , I give you ten louis d'or instead of a thousand pounds for the reason that at the present time a thousand pounds and ten louis d'or will be all the same to you — you will lose the one as readily as you will the other . Take the money , therefore , and good-bye . ” “ Yes , I WILL take it if at the same time you will embrace me . ” “ With pleasure . ” So we parted — on terms of sincere affection . But he was wrong . If I was hard and undiscerning as regards Polina and De Griers , HE was hard and undiscerning as regards Russian people generally . Of myself I say nothing . Yet — yet words are only words . I need to ACT . Above all things I need to think of Switzerland . Tomorrow , tomorrow — Ah , but if only I could set things right tomorrow , and be born again , and rise again from the dead ! But no — I cannot . Yet I must show her what I can do . Even if she should do no more than learn that I can still play the man , it would be worth it . Today it is too late , but TOMORROW ... Yet I have a presentiment that things can never be otherwise . I have got fifteen louis d'or in my possession , although I began with fifteen gulden . If I were to play carefully at the start — But no , no ! Surely I am not such a fool as that ? Yet WHY should I not rise from the dead ? I should require at first but to go cautiously and patiently and the rest would follow . I should require but to put a check upon my nature for one hour , and my fortunes would be changed entirely . Yes , my nature is my weak point . I have only to remember what happened to me some months ago at Roulettenberg , before my final ruin . What a notable instance that was of my capacity for resolution ! On the occasion in question I had lost everything — everything ; yet , just as I was leaving the Casino , I heard another gulden give a rattle in my pocket ! “ Perhaps I shall need it for a meal , ” I thought to myself ; but a hundred paces further on , I changed my mind , and returned . That gulden I staked upon manque — and there is something in the feeling that , though one is alone , and in a foreign land , and far from one 's own home and friends , and ignorant of whence one 's next meal is to come , one is nevertheless staking one 's very last coin ! Well , I won the stake , and in twenty minutes had left the Casino with a hundred and seventy gulden in my pocket ! That is a fact , and it shows what a last remaining gulden can do ....
