The main building was called “ the house , ” to distinguish it from the cottages . The chattering and whistling birds were still at it . Two young girls , the Farival twins , were playing a duet from “ Zampa ” upon the piano . Madame Lebrun was bustling in and out , giving orders in a high key to a yard-boy whenever she got inside the house , and directions in an equally high voice to a dining-room servant whenever she got outside . She was a fresh , pretty woman , clad always in white with elbow sleeves . Her starched skirts crinkled as she came and went . Farther down , before one of the cottages , a lady in black was walking demurely up and down , telling her beads . A good many persons of the pension had gone over to the Cheniere Caminada in Beaudelet 's lugger to hear mass . Some young people were out under the wateroaks playing croquet . Mr. Pontellier 's two children were there sturdy little fellows of four and five . A quadroon nurse followed them about with a faraway , meditative air . Mr. Pontellier finally lit a cigar and began to smoke , letting the paper drag idly from his hand . He fixed his gaze upon a white sunshade that was advancing at snail 's pace from the beach . He could see it plainly between the gaunt trunks of the water-oaks and across the stretch of yellow camomile . The gulf looked far away , melting hazily into the blue of the horizon . The sunshade continued to approach slowly . Beneath its pink-lined shelter were his wife , Mrs. Pontellier , and young Robert Lebrun . When they reached the cottage , the two seated themselves with some appearance of fatigue upon the upper step of the porch , facing each other , each leaning against a supporting post . “ What folly ! to bathe at such an hour in such heat ! ” exclaimed Mr. Pontellier . He himself had taken a plunge at daylight . That was why the morning seemed long to him . “ You are burnt beyond recognition , ” he added , looking at his wife as one looks at a valuable piece of personal property which has suffered some damage . She held up her hands , strong , shapely hands , and surveyed them critically , drawing up her fawn sleeves above the wrists . Looking at them reminded her of her rings , which she had given to her husband before leaving for the beach . She silently reached out to him , and he , understanding , took the rings from his vest pocket and dropped them into her open palm . She slipped them upon her fingers ; then clasping her knees , she looked across at Robert and began to laugh . The rings sparkled upon her fingers . He sent back an answering smile . “ What is it ? ” asked Pontellier , looking lazily and amused from one to the other . It was some utter nonsense ; some adventure out there in the water , and they both tried to relate it at once . It did not seem half so amusing when told . They realized this , and so did Mr. Pontellier . He yawned and stretched himself . Then he got up , saying he had half a mind to go over to Klein 's hotel and play a game of billiards .",

        "context": "Robert talked a good deal about himself . He was very young , and did not know any better . Mrs. Pontellier talked a little about herself for the same reason . Each was interested in what the other said . Robert spoke of his intention to go to Mexico in the autumn , where fortune awaited him . He was always intending to go to Mexico , but some way never got there . Meanwhile he held on to his modest position in a mercantile house in New Orleans , where an equal familiarity with English , French and Spanish gave him no small value as a clerk and correspondent . He was spending his summer vacation , as he always did , with his mother at Grand Isle . In former times , before Robert could remember , “ the house ” had been a summer luxury of the Lebruns . Now , flanked by its dozen or more cottages , which were always filled with exclusive visitors from the “ Quartier Francais , ” it enabled Madame Lebrun to maintain the easy and comfortable existence which appeared to be her birthright . Mrs. Pontellier talked about her father 's Mississippi plantation and her girlhood home in the old Kentucky bluegrass country . She was an American woman , with a small infusion of French which seemed to have been lost in dilution . She read a letter from her sister , who was away in the East , and who had engaged herself to be married . Robert was interested , and wanted to know what manner of girls the sisters were , what the father was like , and how long the mother had been dead . When Mrs. Pontellier folded the letter it was time for her to dress for the early dinner . “ I see Leonce is n't coming back , ” she said , with a glance in the direction whence her husband had disappeared . Robert supposed he was not , as there were a good many New Orleans club men over at Klein 's . When Mrs. Pontellier left him to enter her room , the young man descended the steps and strolled over toward the croquet players , where , during the half-hour before dinner , he amused himself with the little Pontellier children , who were very fond of him . It was eleven o'clock that night when Mr. Pontellier returned from Klein 's hotel . He was in an excellent humor , in high spirits , and very talkative . His entrance awoke his wife , who was in bed and fast asleep when he came in . He talked to her while he undressed , telling her anecdotes and bits of news and gossip that he had gathered during the day . From his trousers pockets he took a fistful of crumpled bank notes and a good deal of silver coin , which he piled on the bureau indiscriminately with keys , knife , handkerchief , and whatever else happened to be in his pockets . She was overcome with sleep , and answered him with little half utterances . He thought it very discouraging that his wife , who was the sole object of his existence , evinced so little interest in things which concerned him , and valued so little his conversation . Mr. Pontellier had forgotten the bonbons and peanuts for the boys . Notwithstanding he loved them very much , and went into the adjoining room where they slept to take a look at them and make sure that they were resting comfortably . The result of his investigation was far from satisfactory . He turned and shifted the youngsters about in bed . One of them began to kick and talk about a basket full of crabs .",

It was like a shadow , like a mist passing across her soul 's summer day . It was strange and unfamiliar ; it was a mood . She did not sit there inwardly upbraiding her husband , lamenting at Fate , which had directed her footsteps to the path which they had taken . She was just having a good cry all to herself . The mosquitoes made merry over her , biting her firm , round arms and nipping at her bare insteps . The little stinging , buzzing imps succeeded in dispelling a mood which might have held her there in the darkness half a night longer . The following morning Mr. Pontellier was up in good time to take the rockaway which was to convey him to the steamer at the wharf . He was returning to the city to his business , and they would not see him again at the Island till the coming Saturday . He had regained his composure , which seemed to have been somewhat impaired the night before . He was eager to be gone , as he looked forward to a lively week in Carondelet Street . Mr. Pontellier gave his wife half of the money which he had brought away from Klein 's hotel the evening before . She liked money as well as most women , and , accepted it with no little satisfaction . “ It will buy a handsome wedding present for Sister Janet ! ” she exclaimed , smoothing out the bills as she counted them one by one . “ Oh ! we 'll treat Sister Janet better than that , my dear , ” he laughed , as he prepared to kiss her good-by . The boys were tumbling about , clinging to his legs , imploring that numerous things be brought back to them . Mr. Pontellier was a great favorite , and ladies , men , children , even nurses , were always on hand to say goodby to him . His wife stood smiling and waving , the boys shouting , as he disappeared in the old rockaway down the sandy road . A few days later a box arrived for Mrs. Pontellier from New Orleans . It was from her husband . It was filled with friandises , with luscious and toothsome bits — the finest of fruits , pates , a rare bottle or two , delicious syrups , and bonbons in abundance . Mrs. Pontellier was always very generous with the contents of such a box ; she was quite used to receiving them when away from home . The pates and fruit were brought to the dining-room ; the bonbons were passed around . And the ladies , selecting with dainty and discriminating fingers and a little greedily , all declared that Mr. Pontellier was the best husband in the world . Mrs. Pontellier was forced to admit that she knew of none better . It would have been a difficult matter for Mr. Pontellier to define to his own satisfaction or any one else 's wherein his wife failed in her duty toward their children . It was something which he felt rather than perceived , and he never voiced the feeling without subsequent regret and ample atonement .",

While the lady at the needle kept up a little running , contemptuous comment : “ Blagueur — farceur — gros bete , va ! ” He never assumed this seriocomic tone when alone with Mrs. Pontellier . She never knew precisely what to make of it ; at that moment it was impossible for her to guess how much of it was jest and what proportion was earnest . It was understood that he had often spoken words of love to Madame Ratignolle , without any thought of being taken seriously . Mrs. Pontellier was glad he had not assumed a similar role toward herself . It would have been unacceptable and annoying . Mrs. Pontellier had brought her sketching materials , which she sometimes dabbled with in an unprofessional way . She liked the dabbling . She felt in it satisfaction of a kind which no other employment afforded her . She had long wished to try herself on Madame Ratignolle . Never had that lady seemed a more tempting subject than at that moment , seated there like some sensuous Madonna , with the gleam of the fading day enriching her splendid color . Robert crossed over and seated himself upon the step below Mrs. Pontellier , that he might watch her work . She handled her brushes with a certain ease and freedom which came , not from long and close acquaintance with them , but from a natural aptitude . Robert followed her work with close attention , giving forth little ejaculatory expressions of appreciation in French , which he addressed to Madame Ratignolle . “ Mais ce n'est pas mal ! Elle s'y connait , elle a de la force , oui . ”",

Once again he repeated the offense . She could not but believe it to be thoughtlessness on his part ; yet that was no reason she should submit to it . She did not remonstrate , except again to repulse him quietly but firmly . He offered no apology . The picture completed bore no resemblance to Madame Ratignolle . She was greatly disappointed to find that it did not look like her . But it was a fair enough piece of work , and in many respects satisfying . Mrs. Pontellier evidently did not think so . After surveying the sketch critically she drew a broad smudge of paint across its surface , and crumpled the paper between her hands . The youngsters came tumbling up the steps , the quadroon following at the respectful distance which they required her to observe . Mrs. Pontellier made them carry her paints and things into the house . She sought to detain them for a little talk and some pleasantry . But they were greatly in earnest .

Madame Ratignolle removed her veil , wiped her face with a rather delicate handkerchief , and fanned herself with the fan which she always carried suspended somewhere about her person by a long , narrow ribbon . Edna removed her collar and opened her dress at the throat . She took the fan from Madame Ratignolle and began to fan both herself and her companion . It was very warm , and for a while they did nothing but exchange remarks about the heat , the sun , the glare . But there was a breeze blowing , a choppy , stiff wind that whipped the water into froth . It fluttered the skirts of the two women and kept them for a while engaged in adjusting , readjusting , tucking in , securing hair-pins and hat-pins . A few persons were sporting some distance away in the water . The beach was very still of human sound at that hour . The lady in black was reading her morning devotions on the porch of a neighboring bathhouse . Two young lovers were exchanging their hearts ’ yearnings beneath the children 's tent , which they had found unoccupied . Edna Pontellier , casting her eyes about , had finally kept them at rest upon the sea . The day was clear and carried the gaze out as far as the blue sky went ; there were a few white clouds suspended idly over the horizon . A lateen sail was visible in the direction of Cat Island , and others to the south seemed almost motionless in the far distance . “ Of whom — of what are you thinking ? ” asked Adele of her companion , whose countenance she had been watching with a little amused attention , arrested by the absorbed expression which seemed to have seized and fixed every feature into a statuesque repose . “ Nothing , ” returned Mrs. Pontellier , with a start , adding at once : “ How stupid ! But it seems to me it is the reply we make instinctively to such a question . Let me see , ” she went on , throwing back her head and narrowing her fine eyes till they shone like two vivid points of light . “ Let me see . I was really not conscious of thinking of anything ; but perhaps I can retrace my thoughts . ” “ Oh ! never mind ! ” laughed Madame Ratignolle . “ I am not quite so exacting . I will let you off this time . It is really too hot to think , especially to think about thinking . ” “ But for the fun of it , ” persisted Edna . “ First of all , the sight of the water stretching so far away , those motionless sails against the blue sky , made a delicious picture that I just wanted to sit and look at . The hot wind beating in my face made me think — without any connection that I can trace of a summer day in Kentucky , of a meadow that seemed as big as the ocean to the very little girl walking through the grass , which was higher than her waist . She threw out her arms as if swimming when she walked , beating the tall grass as one strikes out in the water . Oh , I see the connection now ! ”",

Oh , I see the connection now ! ” “ Where were you going that day in Kentucky , walking through the grass ? ” “ I do n't remember now . I was just walking diagonally across a big field . My sun-bonnet obstructed the view . I could see only the stretch of green before me , and I felt as if I must walk on forever , without coming to the end of it . I do n't remember whether I was frightened or pleased . I must have been entertained . “ Likely as not it was Sunday , ” she laughed ; “ and I was running away from prayers , from the Presbyterian service , read in a spirit of gloom by my father that chills me yet to think of . ” “ And have you been running away from prayers ever since , ma chere ? ” asked Madame Ratignolle , amused . “ No ! oh , no ! ” Edna hastened to say . “ I was a little unthinking child in those days , just following a misleading impulse without question . On the contrary , during one period of my life religion took a firm hold upon me ; after I was twelve and until-until — why , I suppose until now , though I never thought much about it — just driven along by habit . But do you know , ” she broke off , turning her quick eyes upon Madame Ratignolle and leaning forward a little so as to bring her face quite close to that of her companion , “ sometimes I feel this summer as if I were walking through the green meadow again ; idly , aimlessly , unthinking and unguided . ” Madame Ratignolle laid her hand over that of Mrs. Pontellier , which was near her . Seeing that the hand was not withdrawn , she clasped it firmly and warmly . She even stroked it a little , fondly , with the other hand , murmuring in an undertone , “ Pauvre cherie . ”",

I could see only the stretch of green before me , and I felt as if I must walk on forever , without coming to the end of it . I do n't remember whether I was frightened or pleased . I must have been entertained . “ Likely as not it was Sunday , ” she laughed ; “ and I was running away from prayers , from the Presbyterian service , read in a spirit of gloom by my father that chills me yet to think of . ” “ And have you been running away from prayers ever since , ma chere ? ” asked Madame Ratignolle , amused . “ No ! oh , no ! ” Edna hastened to say . “ I was a little unthinking child in those days , just following a misleading impulse without question . On the contrary , during one period of my life religion took a firm hold upon me ; after I was twelve and until-until — why , I suppose until now , though I never thought much about it — just driven along by habit . But do you know , ” she broke off , turning her quick eyes upon Madame Ratignolle and leaning forward a little so as to bring her face quite close to that of her companion , “ sometimes I feel this summer as if I were walking through the green meadow again ; idly , aimlessly , unthinking and unguided . ” Madame Ratignolle laid her hand over that of Mrs. Pontellier , which was near her . Seeing that the hand was not withdrawn , she clasped it firmly and warmly . She even stroked it a little , fondly , with the other hand , murmuring in an undertone , “ Pauvre cherie . ” The action was at first a little confusing to Edna , but she soon lent herself readily to the Creole 's gentle caress . She was not accustomed to an outward and spoken expression of affection , either in herself or in others . She and her younger sister , Janet , had quarreled a good deal through force of unfortunate habit . Her older sister , Margaret , was matronly and dignified , probably from having assumed matronly and housewifely responsibilities too early in life , their mother having died when they were quite young , Margaret was not effusive ; she was practical . Edna had had an occasional girl friend , but whether accidentally or not , they seemed to have been all of one type — the self-contained . She never realized that the reserve of her own character had much , perhaps everything , to do with this . Her most intimate friend at school had been one of rather exceptional intellectual gifts , who wrote fine-sounding essays , which Edna admired and strove to imitate ; and with her she talked and glowed over the English classics , and sometimes held religious and political controversies . Edna often wondered at one propensity which sometimes had inwardly disturbed her without causing any outward show or manifestation on her part . At a very early age — perhaps it was when she traversed the ocean of waving grass — she remembered that she had been passionately enamored of a dignified and sad-eyed cavalry officer who visited her father in Kentucky . She could not leave his presence when he was there , nor remove her eyes from his face , which was something like Napoleon 's , with a lock of black hair failing across the forehead . But the cavalry officer melted imperceptibly out of her existence .",

She leaned draggingly upon his arm as they walked . “ Do me a favor , Robert , ” spoke the pretty woman at his side , almost as soon as she and Robert had started their slow , homeward way . She looked up in his face , leaning on his arm beneath the encircling shadow of the umbrella which he had lifted . “ Granted ; as many as you like , ” he returned , glancing down into her eyes that were full of thoughtfulness and some speculation . “ I only ask for one ; let Mrs. Pontellier alone . ” “ Tiens ! ” he exclaimed , with a sudden , boyish laugh . “ Voila que Madame Ratignolle est jalouse ! ” “ Nonsense ! I 'm in earnest ; I mean what I say . Let Mrs. Pontellier alone . ” “ Why ? ” he asked ; himself growing serious at his companion 's solicitation . “ She is not one of us ; she is not like us . She might make the unfortunate blunder of taking you seriously . ” His face flushed with annoyance , and taking off his soft hat he began to beat it impatiently against his leg as he walked . “ Why should n't she take me seriously ? ” he demanded sharply . “ Am I a comedian , a clown , a jack-in-the-box ? Why should n't she ? You Creoles ! I have no patience with you ! Am I always to be regarded as a feature of an amusing programme ? I hope Mrs. Pontellier does take me seriously . I hope she has discernment enough to find in me something besides the blagueur . If I thought there was any doubt — ” “ Oh , enough , Robert ! ” she broke into his heated outburst . “ You are not thinking of what you are saying . You speak with about as little reflection as we might expect from one of those children down there playing in the sand . If your attentions to any married women here were ever offered with any intention of being convincing , you would not be the gentleman we all know you to be , and you would be unfit to associate with the wives and daughters of the people who trust you . ” Madame Ratignolle had spoken what she believed to be the law and the gospel . The young man shrugged his shoulders impatiently . “ Oh ! well ! That is n't it , ” slamming his hat down vehemently upon his head . “ You ought to feel that such things are not flattering to say to a fellow . ”",

        "context": "His face flushed with annoyance , and taking off his soft hat he began to beat it impatiently against his leg as he walked . “ Why should n't she take me seriously ? ” he demanded sharply . “ Am I a comedian , a clown , a jack-in-the-box ? Why should n't she ? You Creoles ! I have no patience with you ! Am I always to be regarded as a feature of an amusing programme ? I hope Mrs. Pontellier does take me seriously . I hope she has discernment enough to find in me something besides the blagueur . If I thought there was any doubt — ” “ Oh , enough , Robert ! ” she broke into his heated outburst . “ You are not thinking of what you are saying . You speak with about as little reflection as we might expect from one of those children down there playing in the sand . If your attentions to any married women here were ever offered with any intention of being convincing , you would not be the gentleman we all know you to be , and you would be unfit to associate with the wives and daughters of the people who trust you . ” Madame Ratignolle had spoken what she believed to be the law and the gospel . The young man shrugged his shoulders impatiently . “ Oh ! well ! That is n't it , ” slamming his hat down vehemently upon his head . “ You ought to feel that such things are not flattering to say to a fellow . ” “ Should our whole intercourse consist of an exchange of compliments ? Ma foi ! ” “ It is n't pleasant to have a woman tell you — ” he went on , unheedingly , but breaking off suddenly : “ Now if I were like Arobin-you remember Alcee Arobin and that story of the consul 's wife at Biloxi ? ” And he related the story of Alcee Arobin and the consul 's wife ; and another about the tenor of the French Opera , who received letters which should never have been written ; and still other stories , grave and gay , till Mrs. Pontellier and her possible propensity for taking young men seriously was apparently forgotten . Madame Ratignolle , when they had regained her cottage , went in to take the hour 's rest which she considered helpful . Before leaving her , Robert begged her pardon for the impatience — he called it rudeness — with which he had received her well-meant caution . “ You made one mistake , Adele , ” he said , with a light smile ; “ there is no earthly possibility of Mrs. Pontellier ever taking me seriously . You should have warned me against taking myself seriously . Your advice might then have carried some weight and given me subject for some reflection . Au revoir . But you look tired , ” he added , solicitously . “ Would you like a cup of bouillon ? Shall I stir you a toddy ? Let me mix you a toddy with a drop of Angostura . ” She acceded to the suggestion of bouillon , which was grateful and acceptable . He went himself to the kitchen , which was a building apart from the cottages and lying to the rear of the house . And he himself brought her the golden-brown bouillon , in a dainty Sevres cup , with a flaky cracker or two on the saucer .",

An unusual number of husbands , fathers , and friends had come down to stay over Sunday ; and they were being suitably entertained by their families , with the material help of Madame Lebrun .

Each little family group had had its say and exchanged its domestic gossip earlier in the evening . There was now an apparent disposition to relax ; to widen the circle of confidences and give a more general tone to the conversation . Many of the children had been permitted to sit up beyond their usual bedtime . A small band of them were lying on their stomachs on the floor looking at the colored sheets of the comic papers which Mr. Pontellier had brought down . The little Pontellier boys were permitting them to do so , and making their authority felt . Music , dancing , and a recitation or two were the entertainments furnished , or rather , offered . But there was nothing systematic about the programme , no appearance of prearrangement nor even premeditation . At an early hour in the evening the Farival twins were prevailed upon to play the piano . They were girls of fourteen , always clad in the Virgin 's colors , blue and white , having been dedicated to the Blessed Virgin at their baptism . They played a duet from “ Zampa , ” and at the earnest solicitation of every one present followed it with the overture to “ The Poet and the Peasant . ” “ Allez vous-en ! Sapristi ! ” shrieked the parrot outside the door . He was the only being present who possessed sufficient candor to admit that he was not listening to these gracious performances for the first time that summer . Old Monsieur Farival , grandfather of the twins , grew indignant over the interruption , and insisted upon having the bird removed and consigned to regions of darkness . Victor Lebrun objected ; and his decrees were as immutable as those of Fate . The parrot fortunately offered no further interruption to the entertainment , the whole venom of his nature apparently having been cherished up and hurled against the twins in that one impetuous outburst . Later a young brother and sister gave recitations , which every one present had heard many times at winter evening entertainments in the city . A little girl performed a skirt dance in the center of the floor . The mother played her accompaniments and at the same time watched her daughter with greedy admiration and nervous apprehension . She need have had no apprehension . The child was mistress of the situation . She had been properly dressed for the occasion in black tulle and black silk tights . Her little neck and arms were bare , and her hair , artificially crimped , stood out like fluffy black plumes over her head . Her poses were full of grace , and her little black-shod toes twinkled as they shot out and upward with a rapidity and suddenness which were bewildering . But there was no reason why every one should not dance . Madame Ratignolle could not , so it was she who gaily consented to play for the others . She played very well , keeping excellent waltz time and infusing an expression into the strains which was indeed inspiring . She was keeping up her music on account of the children , she said ; because she and her husband both considered it a means of brightening the home and making it attractive .",

They had been permitted to sit up till after the ice-cream , which naturally marked the limit of human indulgence . The ice-cream was passed around with cake — gold and silver cake arranged on platters in alternate slices ; it had been made and frozen during the afternoon back of the kitchen by two black women , under the supervision of Victor . It was pronounced a great success — excellent if it had only contained a little less vanilla or a little more sugar , if it had been frozen a degree harder , and if the salt might have been kept out of portions of it . Victor was proud of his achievement , and went about recommending it and urging every one to partake of it to excess . After Mrs. Pontellier had danced twice with her husband , once with Robert , and once with Monsieur Ratignolle , who was thin and tall and swayed like a reed in the wind when he danced , she went out on the gallery and seated herself on the low window-sill , where she commanded a view of all that went on in the hall and could look out toward the Gulf . There was a soft effulgence in the east . The moon was coming up , and its mystic shimmer was casting a million lights across the distant , restless water . “ Would you like to hear Mademoiselle Reisz play ? ” asked Robert , coming out on the porch where she was . Of course Edna would like to hear Mademoiselle Reisz play ; but she feared it would be useless to entreat her . “ I 'll ask her , ” he said . “ I 'll tell her that you want to hear her . She likes you . She will come . ” He turned and hurried away to one of the far cottages , where Mademoiselle Reisz was shuffling away . She was dragging a chair in and out of her room , and at intervals objecting to the crying of a baby , which a nurse in the adjoining cottage was endeavoring to put to sleep . She was a disagreeable little woman , no longer young , who had quarreled with almost every one , owing to a temper which was self-assertive and a disposition to trample upon the rights of others . Robert prevailed upon her without any too great difficulty . She entered the hall with him during a lull in the dance . She made an awkward , imperious little bow as she went in . She was a homely woman , with a small weazened face and body and eyes that glowed . She had absolutely no taste in dress , and wore a batch of rusty black lace with a bunch of artificial violets pinned to the side of her hair . “ Ask Mrs. Pontellier what she would like to hear me play , ” she requested of Robert . She sat perfectly still before the piano , not touching the keys , while Robert carried her message to Edna at the window . A general air of surprise and genuine satisfaction fell upon every one as they saw the pianist enter . There was a settling down , and a prevailing air of expectancy everywhere .

She would not dare to choose , and begged that Mademoiselle Reisz would please herself in her selections .",

She likes you . She will come . ” He turned and hurried away to one of the far cottages , where Mademoiselle Reisz was shuffling away . She was dragging a chair in and out of her room , and at intervals objecting to the crying of a baby , which a nurse in the adjoining cottage was endeavoring to put to sleep . She was a disagreeable little woman , no longer young , who had quarreled with almost every one , owing to a temper which was self-assertive and a disposition to trample upon the rights of others . Robert prevailed upon her without any too great difficulty . She entered the hall with him during a lull in the dance . She made an awkward , imperious little bow as she went in . She was a homely woman , with a small weazened face and body and eyes that glowed . She had absolutely no taste in dress , and wore a batch of rusty black lace with a bunch of artificial violets pinned to the side of her hair . “ Ask Mrs. Pontellier what she would like to hear me play , ” she requested of Robert . She sat perfectly still before the piano , not touching the keys , while Robert carried her message to Edna at the window . A general air of surprise and genuine satisfaction fell upon every one as they saw the pianist enter . There was a settling down , and a prevailing air of expectancy everywhere . Edna was a trifle embarrassed at being thus signaled out for the imperious little woman 's favor . She would not dare to choose , and begged that Mademoiselle Reisz would please herself in her selections .",

She would not dare to choose , and begged that Mademoiselle Reisz would please herself in her selections . Edna was what she herself called very fond of music . Musical strains , well rendered , had a way of evoking pictures in her mind . She sometimes liked to sit in the room of mornings when Madame Ratignolle played or practiced . One piece which that lady played Edna had entitled “ Solitude . ” It was a short , plaintive , minor strain . The name of the piece was something else , but she called it “ Solitude . ” When she heard it there came before her imagination the figure of a man standing beside a desolate rock on the seashore . He was naked . His attitude was one of hopeless resignation as he looked toward a distant bird winging its flight away from him . Another piece called to her mind a dainty young woman clad in an Empire gown , taking mincing dancing steps as she came down a long avenue between tall hedges . Again , another reminded her of children at play , and still another of nothing on earth but a demure lady stroking a cat . The very first chords which Mademoiselle Reisz struck upon the piano sent a keen tremor down Mrs. Pontellier 's spinal column . It was not the first time she had heard an artist at the piano . Perhaps it was the first time she was ready , perhaps the first time her being was tempered to take an impress of the abiding truth .",

Robert had pursued a system of lessons almost daily ; and he was nearly at the point of discouragement in realizing the futility of his efforts . A certain ungovernable dread hung about her when in the water , unless there was a hand near by that might reach out and reassure her . But that night she was like the little tottering , stumbling , clutching child , who of a sudden realizes its powers , and walks for the first time alone , boldly and with over-confidence . She could have shouted for joy . She did shout for joy , as with a sweeping stroke or two she lifted her body to the surface of the water . A feeling of exultation overtook her , as if some power of significant import had been given her to control the working of her body and her soul . She grew daring and reckless , overestimating her strength . She wanted to swim far out , where no woman had swum before . Her unlooked-for achievement was the subject of wonder , applause , and admiration . Each one congratulated himself that his special teachings had accomplished this desired end . “ How easy it is ! ” she thought . “ It is nothing , ” she said aloud ; “ why did I not discover before that it was nothing . Think of the time I have lost splashing about like a baby ! ” She would not join the groups in their sports and bouts , but intoxicated with her newly conquered power , she swam out alone . She turned her face seaward to gather in an impression of space and solitude , which the vast expanse of water , meeting and melting with the moonlit sky , conveyed to her excited fancy . As she swam she seemed to be reaching out for the unlimited in which to lose herself . Once she turned and looked toward the shore , toward the people she had left there . She had not gone any great distance that is , what would have been a great distance for an experienced swimmer . But to her unaccustomed vision the stretch of water behind her assumed the aspect of a barrier which her unaided strength would never be able to overcome . A quick vision of death smote her soul , and for a second of time appalled and enfeebled her senses . But by an effort she rallied her staggering faculties and managed to regain the land . She made no mention of her encounter with death and her flash of terror , except to say to her husband , “ I thought I should have perished out there alone . ” “ You were not so very far , my dear ; I was watching you ” , he told her . Edna went at once to the bath-house , and she had put on her dry clothes and was ready to return home before the others had left the water . She started to walk away alone . They all called to her and shouted to her . She waved a dissenting hand , and went on , paying no further heed to their renewed cries which sought to detain her .",

On the twenty-eighth of August , at the hour of midnight , and if the moon is shining — the moon must be shining — a spirit that has haunted these shores for ages rises up from the Gulf . With its own penetrating vision the spirit seeks some one mortal worthy to hold him company , worthy of being exalted for a few hours into realms of the semi-celestials . His search has always hitherto been fruitless , and he has sunk back , disheartened , into the sea . But to-night he found Mrs. Pontellier . Perhaps he will never wholly release her from the spell . Perhaps she will never again suffer a poor , unworthy earthling to walk in the shadow of her divine presence . ”",

Why did n't you stay out there with the others ? ” “ I never thought of it . ” “ Thought of what ? ” “ Of anything . What difference does it make ? ” “ I 'm very tired , ” she uttered , complainingly . “ I know you are . ” “ You do n't know anything about it . Why should you know ? I never was so exhausted in my life . But it is n't unpleasant . A thousand emotions have swept through me to-night . I do n't comprehend half of them . Do n't mind what I 'm saying ; I am just thinking aloud . I wonder if I shall ever be stirred again as Mademoiselle Reisz 's playing moved me to-night . I wonder if any night on earth will ever again be like this one . It is like a night in a dream . The people about me are like some uncanny , half-human beings . There must be spirits abroad to-night . ” “ There are , ” whispered Robert , “ Did n't you know this was the twenty-eighth of August ? ” “ The twenty-eighth of August ? ” “ Yes . On the twenty-eighth of August , at the hour of midnight , and if the moon is shining — the moon must be shining — a spirit that has haunted these shores for ages rises up from the Gulf . With its own penetrating vision the spirit seeks some one mortal worthy to hold him company , worthy of being exalted for a few hours into realms of the semi-celestials . His search has always hitherto been fruitless , and he has sunk back , disheartened , into the sea . But to-night he found Mrs. Pontellier . Perhaps he will never wholly release her from the spell . Perhaps she will never again suffer a poor , unworthy earthling to walk in the shadow of her divine presence . ” “ Do n't banter me , ” she said , wounded at what appeared to be his flippancy . He did not mind the entreaty , but the tone with its delicate note of pathos was like a reproach . He could not explain ; he could not tell her that he had penetrated her mood and understood . He said nothing except to offer her his arm , for , by her own admission , she was exhausted . She had been walking alone with her arms hanging limp , letting her white skirts trail along the dewy path . She took his arm , but she did not lean upon it . She let her hand lie listlessly , as though her thoughts were elsewhere — somewhere in advance of her body , and she was striving to overtake them .",

She extended herself in the hammock with a deep breath of relief . She was not a supercilious or an over-dainty woman .

Do n't swing the hammock .

Come on , ” and he mounted the steps and went into their room . “ Edna ! ” called Mr. Pontellier from within , after a few moments had gone by . “ Do n't wait for me , ” she answered . He thrust his head through the door . “ You will take cold out there , ” he said , irritably . “ What folly is this ? Why do n't you come in ? ” “ It is n't cold ; I have my shawl . ” “ The mosquitoes will devour you . ” “ There are no mosquitoes . ” She heard him moving about the room ; every sound indicating impatience and irritation . Another time she would have gone in at his request . She would , through habit , have yielded to his desire ; not with any sense of submission or obedience to his compelling wishes , but unthinkingly , as we walk , move , sit , stand , go through the daily treadmill of the life which has been portioned out to us . “ Edna , dear , are you not coming in soon ? ” he asked again , this time fondly , with a note of entreaty . “ No ; I am going to stay out here . ” “ This is more than folly , ” he blurted out . “ I can n't permit you to stay out there all night .

Of course she had ; she remembered that she had . But she could not realize why or how she should have yielded , feeling as she then did .",

Come on , ” and he mounted the steps and went into their room . “ Edna ! ” called Mr. Pontellier from within , after a few moments had gone by . “ Do n't wait for me , ” she answered . He thrust his head through the door . “ You will take cold out there , ” he said , irritably . “ What folly is this ? Why do n't you come in ? ” “ It is n't cold ; I have my shawl . ” “ The mosquitoes will devour you . ” “ There are no mosquitoes . ” She heard him moving about the room ; every sound indicating impatience and irritation . Another time she would have gone in at his request . She would , through habit , have yielded to his desire ; not with any sense of submission or obedience to his compelling wishes , but unthinkingly , as we walk , move , sit , stand , go through the daily treadmill of the life which has been portioned out to us . “ Edna , dear , are you not coming in soon ? ” he asked again , this time fondly , with a note of entreaty . “ No ; I am going to stay out here . ” “ This is more than folly , ” he blurted out . “ I can n't permit you to stay out there all night . You must come in the house instantly . ” With a writhing motion she settled herself more securely in the hammock . She perceived that her will had blazed up , stubborn and resistant . She could not at that moment have done other than denied and resisted . She wondered if her husband had ever spoken to her like that before , and if she had submitted to his command . Of course she had ; she remembered that she had . But she could not realize why or how she should have yielded , feeling as she then did . “ Leonce , go to bed , ” she said , “ I mean to stay out here .

But he would not quarrel with so old a man as Monsieur Farival , so he quarreled with Mariequita . The girl was deprecatory at one moment , appealing to Robert . She was saucy the next , moving her head up and down , making “ eyes ” at Robert and making “ mouths ” at Beaudelet . The lovers were all alone . They saw nothing , they heard nothing . The lady in black was counting her beads for the third time . Old Monsieur Farival talked incessantly of what he knew about handling a boat , and of what Beaudelet did not know on the same subject . Edna liked it all . She looked Mariequita up and down , from her ugly brown toes to her pretty black eyes , and back again . “ Why does she look at me like that ? ” inquired the girl of Robert . “ Maybe she thinks you are pretty . Shall I ask her ? ” “ No . Is she your sweetheart ? ” “ She 's a married lady , and has two children . ” “ Oh ! well ! Francisco ran away with Sylvano 's wife , who had four children . They took all his money and one of the children and stole his boat . ” “ Shut up ! ” “ Does she understand ? ” “ Oh , hush ! ” “ Are those two married over there — leaning on each other ? ” “ Of course not , ” laughed Robert . “ Of course not , ” echoed Mariequita , with a serious , confirmatory bob of the head . The sun was high up and beginning to bite . The swift breeze seemed to Edna to bury the sting of it into the pores of her face and hands . Robert held his umbrella over her . As they went cutting sidewise through the water , the sails bellied taut , with the wind filling and overflowing them . Old Monsieur Farival laughed sardonically at something as he looked at the sails , and Beaudelet swore at the old man under his breath . Sailing across the bay to the Cheniere Caminada , Edna felt as if she were being borne away from some anchorage which had held her fast , whose chains had been loosening — had snapped the night before when the mystic spirit was abroad , leaving her free to drift whithersoever she chose to set her sails . Robert spoke to her incessantly ; he no longer noticed Mariequita . The girl had shrimps in her bamboo basket . They were covered with Spanish moss . She beat the moss down impatiently , and muttered to herself sullenly .",

        "context": "Robert knew the girl , and he talked to her a little in the boat . No one present understood what they said . Her name was Mariequita . She had a round , sly , piquant face and pretty black eyes . Her hands were small , and she kept them folded over the handle of her basket . Her feet were broad and coarse . She did not strive to hide them . Edna looked at her feet , and noticed the sand and slime between her brown toes . Beaudelet grumbled because Mariequita was there , taking up so much room . In reality he was annoyed at having old Monsieur Farival , who considered himself the better sailor of the two . But he would not quarrel with so old a man as Monsieur Farival , so he quarreled with Mariequita . The girl was deprecatory at one moment , appealing to Robert . She was saucy the next , moving her head up and down , making “ eyes ” at Robert and making “ mouths ” at Beaudelet . The lovers were all alone . They saw nothing , they heard nothing . The lady in black was counting her beads for the third time . Old Monsieur Farival talked incessantly of what he knew about handling a boat , and of what Beaudelet did not know on the same subject . Edna liked it all . She looked Mariequita up and down , from her ugly brown toes to her pretty black eyes , and back again . “ Why does she look at me like that ? ” inquired the girl of Robert . “ Maybe she thinks you are pretty . Shall I ask her ? ” “ No . Is she your sweetheart ? ” “ She 's a married lady , and has two children . ” “ Oh ! well ! Francisco ran away with Sylvano 's wife , who had four children . They took all his money and one of the children and stole his boat . ” “ Shut up ! ” “ Does she understand ? ” “ Oh , hush ! ” “ Are those two married over there — leaning on each other ? ” “ Of course not , ” laughed Robert . “ Of course not , ” echoed Mariequita , with a serious , confirmatory bob of the head . The sun was high up and beginning to bite . The swift breeze seemed to Edna to bury the sting of it into the pores of her face and hands . Robert held his umbrella over her . As they went cutting sidewise through the water , the sails bellied taut , with the wind filling and overflowing them . Old Monsieur Farival laughed sardonically at something as he looked at the sails , and Beaudelet swore at the old man under his breath . Sailing across the bay to the Cheniere Caminada , Edna felt as if she were being borne away from some anchorage which had held her fast , whose chains had been loosening — had snapped the night before when the mystic spirit was abroad , leaving her free to drift whithersoever she chose to set her sails . Robert spoke to her incessantly ; he no longer noticed Mariequita . The girl had shrimps in her bamboo basket . They were covered with Spanish moss . She beat the moss down impatiently , and muttered to herself sullenly .",

She beat the moss down impatiently , and muttered to herself sullenly . “ Let us go to Grande Terre to-morrow ? ” said Robert in a low voice . “ What shall we do there ? ” “ Climb up the hill to the old fort and look at the little wriggling gold snakes , and watch the lizards sun themselves . ” She gazed away toward Grande Terre and thought she would like to be alone there with Robert , in the sun , listening to the ocean 's roar and watching the slimy lizards writhe in and out among the ruins of the old fort . “ And the next day or the next we can sail to the Bayou Brulow , ” he went on . “ What shall we do there ? ” “ Anything — cast bait for fish . ” “ No ; we 'll go back to Grande Terre . Let the fish alone . ” “ We 'll go wherever you like , ” he said . “ I 'll have Tonie come over and help me patch and trim my boat . We shall not need Beaudelet nor any one .

She wondered what had become of the rest of the party . She peeped out at him two or three times as she stood washing herself in the little basin between the windows . Madame Antoine had laid some coarse , clean towels upon a chair , and had placed a box of poudre de riz within easy reach . Edna dabbed the powder upon her nose and cheeks as she looked at herself closely in the little distorted mirror which hung on the wall above the basin .

She took her seat at table between old Monsieur Farival and Madame Ratignolle . As she seated herself and was about to begin to eat her soup , which had been served when she entered the room , several persons informed her simultaneously that Robert was going to Mexico .

This she had thought nothing of , though she was surprised when he did not join her later in the afternoon , when she went down to the beach . She looked across at him , where he sat beside Madame Lebrun , who presided . Edna 's face was a blank picture of bewilderment , which she never thought of disguising . He lifted his eyebrows with the pretext of a smile as he returned her glance . He looked embarrassed and uneasy . “ When is he going ? ” she asked of everybody in general , as if Robert were not there to answer for himself . “ To-night ! ” “ This very evening ! ” “ Did you ever ! ” “ What possesses him ! ” were some of the replies she gathered , uttered simultaneously in French and English . “ Impossible ! ” she exclaimed . “ How can a person start off from Grand Isle to Mexico at a moment 's notice , as if he were going over to Klein 's or to the wharf or down to the beach ? ” “ I said all along I was going to Mexico ; I 've been saying so for years ! ” cried Robert , in an excited and irritable tone , with the air of a man defending himself against a swarm of stinging insects .

She had forced herself to eat most of her soup , and now she was picking the flaky bits of a court bouillon with her fork . The lovers were profiting by the general conversation on Mexico to speak in whispers of matters which they rightly considered were interesting to no one but themselves .

        "context": "The lovers were profiting by the general conversation on Mexico to speak in whispers of matters which they rightly considered were interesting to no one but themselves . The lady in black had once received a pair of prayer-beads of curious workmanship from Mexico , with very special indulgence attached to them , but she had never been able to ascertain whether the indulgence extended outside the Mexican border . Father Fochel of the Cathedral had attempted to explain it ; but he had not done so to her satisfaction . And she begged that Robert would interest himself , and discover , if possible , whether she was entitled to the indulgence accompanying the remarkably curious Mexican prayer-beads . Madame Ratignolle hoped that Robert would exercise extreme caution in dealing with the Mexicans , who , she considered , were a treacherous people , unscrupulous and revengeful . She trusted she did them no injustice in thus condemning them as a race . She had known personally but one Mexican , who made and sold excellent tamales , and whom she would have trusted implicitly , so soft-spoken was he . One day he was arrested for stabbing his wife . She never knew whether he had been hanged or not . Victor had grown hilarious , and was attempting to tell an anecdote about a Mexican girl who served chocolate one winter in a restaurant in Dauphine Street . No one would listen to him but old Monsieur Farival , who went into convulsions over the droll story . Edna wondered if they had all gone mad , to be talking and clamoring at that rate . She herself could think of nothing to say about Mexico or the Mexicans . “ At what time do you leave ? ” she asked Robert . “ At ten , ” he told her . “ Beaudelet wants to wait for the moon . ” “ Are you all ready to go ? ” “ Quite ready .

Are you going right away ? ” He lit a match and looked at his watch . “ In twenty minutes , ” he said . The sudden and brief flare of the match emphasized the darkness for a while . He sat down upon a stool which the children had left out on the porch . “ Get a chair , ” said Edna . “ This will do , ” he replied .

The present alone was significant ; was hers , to torture her as it was doing then with the biting conviction that she had lost that which she had held , that she had been denied that which her impassioned , newly awakened being demanded . “ Do you miss your friend greatly ? ” asked Mademoiselle Reisz one morning as she came creeping up behind Edna , who had just left her cottage on her way to the beach . She spent much of her time in the water since she had acquired finally the art of swimming . As their stay at Grand Isle drew near its close , she felt that she could not give too much time to a diversion which afforded her the only real pleasurable moments that she knew . When Mademoiselle Reisz came and touched her upon the shoulder and spoke to her , the woman seemed to echo the thought which was ever in Edna 's mind ; or , better , the feeling which constantly possessed her . Robert 's going had some way taken the brightness , the color , the meaning out of everything . The conditions of her life were in no way changed , but her whole existence was dulled , like a faded garment which seems to be no longer worth wearing . She sought him everywhere — in others whom she induced to talk about him . She went up in the mornings to Madame Lebrun 's room , braving the clatter of the old sewing-machine . She sat there and chatted at intervals as Robert had done . She gazed around the room at the pictures and photographs hanging upon the wall , and discovered in some corner an old family album , which she examined with the keenest interest , appealing to Madame Lebrun for enlightenment concerning the many figures and faces which she discovered between its pages . There was a picture of Madame Lebrun with Robert as a baby , seated in her lap , a round-faced infant with a fist in his mouth . The eyes alone in the baby suggested the man . And that was he also in kilts , at the age of five , wearing long curls and holding a whip in his hand . It made Edna laugh , and she laughed , too , at the portrait in his first long trousers ; while another interested her , taken when he left for college , looking thin , long-faced , with eyes full of fire , ambition and great intentions . But there was no recent picture , none which suggested the Robert who had gone away five days ago , leaving a void and wilderness behind him .",

Edna tried to appease her friend , to explain . “ I would give up the unessential ; I would give my money , I would give my life for my children ; but I would n't give myself . I can n't make it more clear ; it 's only something which I am beginning to comprehend , which is revealing itself to me . ” “ I do n't know what you would call the essential , or what you mean by the unessential , ” said Madame Ratignolle , cheerfully ; “ but a woman who would give her life for her children could do no more than that — your Bible tells you so . I 'm sure I could n't do more than that . ” “ Oh , yes you could ! ” laughed Edna . She was not surprised at Mademoiselle Reisz 's question the morning that lady , following her to the beach , tapped her on the shoulder and asked if she did not greatly miss her young friend . “ Oh , good morning , Mademoiselle ; is it you ? Why , of course I miss Robert . Are you going down to bathe ? ” “ Why should I go down to bathe at the very end of the season when I have n't been in the surf all summer , ” replied the woman , disagreeably . “ I beg your pardon , ” offered Edna , in some embarrassment , for she should have remembered that Mademoiselle Reisz 's avoidance of the water had furnished a theme for much pleasantry . Some among them thought it was on account of her false hair , or the dread of getting the violets wet , while others attributed it to the natural aversion for water sometimes believed to accompany the artistic temperament . Mademoiselle offered Edna some chocolates in a paper bag , which she took from her pocket , by way of showing that she bore no ill feeling . She habitually ate chocolates for their sustaining quality ; they contained much nutriment in small compass , she said . They saved her from starvation , as Madame Lebrun 's table was utterly impossible ; and no one save so impertinent a woman as Madame Lebrun could think of offering such food to people and requiring them to pay for it .",

        "context": "This had been the programme which Mrs. Pontellier had religiously followed since her marriage , six years before . Certain evenings during the week she and her husband attended the opera or sometimes the play . Mr. Pontellier left his home in the mornings between nine and ten o'clock , and rarely returned before half-past six or seven in the evening — dinner being served at half-past seven . He and his wife seated themselves at table one Tuesday evening , a few weeks after their return from Grand Isle . They were alone together . The boys were being put to bed ; the patter of their bare , escaping feet could be heard occasionally , as well as the pursuing voice of the quadroon , lifted in mild protest and entreaty . Mrs. Pontellier did not wear her usual Tuesday reception gown ; she was in ordinary house dress . Mr. Pontellier , who was observant about such things , noticed it , as he served the soup and handed it to the boy in waiting . “ Tired out , Edna ? Whom did you have ? Many callers ? ” he asked . He tasted his soup and began to season it with pepper , salt , vinegar , mustard — everything within reach . “ There were a good many , ” replied Edna , who was eating her soup with evident satisfaction . “ I found their cards when I got home ; I was out . ” “ Out ! ” exclaimed her husband , with something like genuine consternation in his voice as he laid down the vinegar cruet and looked at her through his glasses . “ Why , what could have taken you out on Tuesday ? What did you have to do ? ” “ Nothing . I simply felt like going out , and I went out . ” “ Well , I hope you left some suitable excuse , ” said her husband , somewhat appeased , as he added a dash of cayenne pepper to the soup . “ No , I left no excuse . I told Joe to say I was out , that was all . ” “ Why , my dear , I should think you 'd understand by this time that people do n't do such things ; we 've got to observe les convenances if we ever expect to get on and keep up with the procession .

        "context": "In a sweeping passion she seized a glass vase from the table and flung it upon the tiles of the hearth . She wanted to destroy something . The crash and clatter were what she wanted to hear . A maid , alarmed at the din of breaking glass , entered the room to discover what was the matter . “ A vase fell upon the hearth , ” said Edna . “ Never mind ; leave it till morning . ” “ Oh ! you might get some of the glass in your feet , ma'am , ” insisted the young woman , picking up bits of the broken vase that were scattered upon the carpet . “ And here 's your ring , ma'am , under the chair . ” Edna held out her hand , and taking the ring , slipped it upon her finger . The following morning Mr. Pontellier , upon leaving for his office , asked Edna if she would not meet him in town in order to look at some new fixtures for the library . “ I hardly think we need new fixtures , Leonce . Do n't let us get anything new ; you are too extravagant . I do n't believe you ever think of saving or putting by . ” “ The way to become rich is to make money , my dear Edna , not to save it , ” he said . He regretted that she did not feel inclined to go with him and select new fixtures . He kissed her good-by , and told her she was not looking well and must take care of herself . She was unusually pale and very quiet . She stood on the front veranda as he quitted the house , and absently picked a few sprays of jessamine that grew upon a trellis near by . She inhaled the odor of the blossoms and thrust them into the bosom of her white morning gown . The boys were dragging along the banquette a small “ express wagon , ” which they had filled with blocks and sticks . The quadroon was following them with little quick steps , having assumed a fictitious animation and alacrity for the occasion . A fruit vender was crying his wares in the street . Edna looked straight before her with a self-absorbed expression upon her face . She felt no interest in anything about her . The street , the children , the fruit vender , the flowers growing there under her eyes , were all part and parcel of an alien world which had suddenly become antagonistic . She went back into the house . She had thought of speaking to the cook concerning her blunders of the previous night ; but Mr. Pontellier had saved her that disagreeable mission , for which she was so poorly fitted . Mr. Pontellier 's arguments were usually convincing with those whom he employed . He left home feeling quite sure that he and Edna would sit down that evening , and possibly a few subsequent evenings , to a dinner deserving of the name .",

        "context": "Edna was on her way to Madame Ratignolle 's . Their intimacy , begun at Grand Isle , had not declined , and they had seen each other with some frequency since their return to the city . The Ratignolles lived at no great distance from Edna 's home , on the corner of a side street , where Monsieur Ratignolle owned and conducted a drug store which enjoyed a steady and prosperous trade . His father had been in the business before him , and Monsieur Ratignolle stood well in the community and bore an enviable reputation for integrity and clearheadedness . His family lived in commodious apartments over the store , having an entrance on the side within the porte cochere . There was something which Edna thought very French , very foreign , about their whole manner of living . In the large and pleasant salon which extended across the width of the house , the Ratignolles entertained their friends once a fortnight with a soiree musicale , sometimes diversified by card-playing . There was a friend who played upon the ‘ cello . One brought his flute and another his violin , while there were some who sang and a number who performed upon the piano with various degrees of taste and agility . The Ratignolles ’ soirees musicales were widely known , and it was considered a privilege to be invited to them . Edna found her friend engaged in assorting the clothes which had returned that morning from the laundry . She at once abandoned her occupation upon seeing Edna , who had been ushered without ceremony into her presence . “ ‘ Cite can do it as well as I ; it is really her business , ” she explained to Edna , who apologized for interrupting her . And she summoned a young black woman , whom she instructed , in French , to be very careful in checking off the list which she handed her . She told her to notice particularly if a fine linen handkerchief of Monsieur Ratignolle 's , which was missing last week , had been returned ; and to be sure to set to one side such pieces as required mending and darning . Then placing an arm around Edna 's waist , she led her to the front of the house , to the salon , where it was cool and sweet with the odor of great roses that stood upon the hearth in jars . Madame Ratignolle looked more beautiful than ever there at home , in a neglige which left her arms almost wholly bare and exposed the rich , melting curves of her white throat . “ Perhaps I shall be able to paint your picture some day , ” said Edna with a smile when they were seated . She produced the roll of sketches and started to unfold them . “ I believe I ought to work again . I feel as if I wanted to be doing something . What do you think of them ? Do you think it worth while to take it up again and study some more ? I might study for a while with Laidpore . ” She knew that Madame Ratignolle 's opinion in such a matter would be next to valueless , that she herself had not alone decided , but determined ; but she sought the words of praise and encouragement that would help her to put heart into her venture .",

        "context": "Then placing an arm around Edna 's waist , she led her to the front of the house , to the salon , where it was cool and sweet with the odor of great roses that stood upon the hearth in jars . Madame Ratignolle looked more beautiful than ever there at home , in a neglige which left her arms almost wholly bare and exposed the rich , melting curves of her white throat . “ Perhaps I shall be able to paint your picture some day , ” said Edna with a smile when they were seated . She produced the roll of sketches and started to unfold them . “ I believe I ought to work again . I feel as if I wanted to be doing something . What do you think of them ? Do you think it worth while to take it up again and study some more ? I might study for a while with Laidpore . ” She knew that Madame Ratignolle 's opinion in such a matter would be next to valueless , that she herself had not alone decided , but determined ; but she sought the words of praise and encouragement that would help her to put heart into her venture . “ Your talent is immense , dear ! ” “ Nonsense ! ” protested Edna , well pleased . “ Immense , I tell you , ” persisted Madame Ratignolle , surveying the sketches one by one , at close range , then holding them at arm 's length , narrowing her eyes , and dropping her head on one side . “ Surely , this Bavarian peasant is worthy of framing ; and this basket of apples ! never have I seen anything more lifelike . One might almost be tempted to reach out a hand and take one . ” Edna could not control a feeling which bordered upon complacency at her friend 's praise , even realizing , as she did , its true worth . She retained a few of the sketches , and gave all the rest to Madame Ratignolle , who appreciated the gift far beyond its value and proudly exhibited the pictures to her husband when he came up from the store a little later for his midday dinner . Mr. Ratignolle was one of those men who are called the salt of the earth . His cheerfulness was unbounded , and it was matched by his goodness of heart , his broad charity , and common sense . He and his wife spoke English with an accent which was only discernible through its un-English emphasis and a certain carefulness and deliberation . Edna 's husband spoke English with no accent whatever . The Ratignolles understood each other perfectly . If ever the fusion of two human beings into one has been accomplished on this sphere it was surely in their union . As Edna seated herself at table with them she thought , “ Better a dinner of herbs , ” though it did not take her long to discover that it was no dinner of herbs , but a delicious repast , simple , choice , and in every way satisfying .",

She was happy to be alive and breathing , when her whole being seemed to be one with the sunlight , the color , the odors , the luxuriant warmth of some perfect Southern day . She liked then to wander alone into strange and unfamiliar places . She discovered many a sunny , sleepy corner , fashioned to dream in . And she found it good to dream and to be alone and unmolested .",

The two had seated themselves on a little bumpy sofa which stood against the wall . “ I am glad , however , that you came . I have the water boiling back there , and was just about to make some coffee . You will drink a cup with me . And how is la belle dame ? Always handsome ! always healthy ! always contented ! ” She took Edna 's hand between her strong wiry fingers , holding it loosely without warmth , and executing a sort of double theme upon the back and palm . “ Yes , ” she went on ; “ I sometimes thought : ‘ She will never come . She promised as those women in society always do , without meaning it . She will not come . ’ For I really do n't believe you like me , Mrs. Pontellier . ” “ I do n't know whether I like you or not , ” replied Edna , gazing down at the little woman with a quizzical look . The candor of Mrs. Pontellier 's admission greatly pleased Mademoiselle Reisz . She expressed her gratification by repairing forthwith to the region of the gasoline stove and rewarding her guest with the promised cup of coffee . The coffee and the biscuit accompanying it proved very acceptable to Edna , who had declined refreshment at Madame Lebrun 's and was now beginning to feel hungry . Mademoiselle set the tray which she brought in upon a small table near at hand , and seated herself once again on the lumpy sofa .",

There were plenty of windows in her little front room . They were for the most part dingy , but as they were nearly always open it did not make so much difference . They often admitted into the room a good deal of smoke and soot ; but at the same time all the light and air that there was came through them . From her windows could be seen the crescent of the river , the masts of ships and the big chimneys of the Mississippi steamers . A magnificent piano crowded the apartment . In the next room she slept , and in the third and last she harbored a gasoline stove on which she cooked her meals when disinclined to descend to the neighboring restaurant . It was there also that she ate , keeping her belongings in a rare old buffet , dingy and battered from a hundred years of use . When Edna knocked at Mademoiselle Reisz 's front room door and entered , she discovered that person standing beside the window , engaged in mending or patching an old prunella gaiter . The little musician laughed all over when she saw Edna . Her laugh consisted of a contortion of the face and all the muscles of the body . She seemed strikingly homely , standing there in the afternoon light . She still wore the shabby lace and the artificial bunch of violets on the side of her head . “ So you remembered me at last , ” said Mademoiselle . “ I had said to myself , ‘ Ah , bah ! she will never come . ’ ” “ Did you want me to come ? ” asked Edna with a smile . “ I had not thought much about it , ” answered Mademoiselle .

I have the water boiling back there , and was just about to make some coffee . You will drink a cup with me . And how is la belle dame ?

She promised as those women in society always do , without meaning it . She will not come . ’ For I really do n't believe you like me , Mrs. Pontellier . ” “ I do n't know whether I like you or not , ” replied Edna , gazing down at the little woman with a quizzical look .

        "context": "The candor of Mrs. Pontellier 's admission greatly pleased Mademoiselle Reisz . She expressed her gratification by repairing forthwith to the region of the gasoline stove and rewarding her guest with the promised cup of coffee . The coffee and the biscuit accompanying it proved very acceptable to Edna , who had declined refreshment at Madame Lebrun 's and was now beginning to feel hungry . Mademoiselle set the tray which she brought in upon a small table near at hand , and seated herself once again on the lumpy sofa . “ I have had a letter from your friend , ” she remarked , as she poured a little cream into Edna 's cup and handed it to her . “ My friend ? ” “ Yes , your friend Robert . He wrote to me from the City of Mexico . ” “ Wrote to YOU ? ” repeated Edna in amazement , stirring her coffee absently . “ Yes , to me . Why not ? Do n't stir all the warmth out of your coffee ; drink it . Though the letter might as well have been sent to you ; it was nothing but Mrs. Pontellier from beginning to end . ” “ Let me see it , ” requested the young woman , entreatingly . “ No ; a letter concerns no one but the person who writes it and the one to whom it is written . ” “ Have n't you just said it concerned me from beginning to end ? ” “ It was written about you , not to you . ‘ Have you seen Mrs. Pontellier ? How is she looking ? ’ he asks . ‘ As Mrs. Pontellier says , ’ or ‘ as Mrs. Pontellier once said . ’ ‘ If Mrs. Pontellier should call upon you , play for her that Impromptu of Chopin 's , my favorite . I heard it here a day or two ago , but not as you play it . I should like to know how it affects her , ’ and so on , as if he supposed we were constantly in each other 's society . ” “ Let me see the letter . ” “ Oh , no . ” “ Have you answered it ? ” “ No . ” “ Let me see the letter . ” “ No , and again , no . ” “ Then play the Impromptu for me . ” “ It is growing late ; what time do you have to be home ? ” “ Time does n't concern me . Your question seems a little rude . Play the Impromptu . ” “ But you have told me nothing of yourself . What are you doing ? ” “ Painting ! ” laughed Edna . “ I am becoming an artist . Think of it ! ” “ Ah ! an artist ! You have pretensions , Madame . ” “ Why pretensions ? Do you think I could not become an artist ? ” “ I do not know you well enough to say . I do not know your talent or your temperament . To be an artist includes much ; one must possess many gifts — absolute gifts — which have not been acquired by one 's own effort . And , moreover , to succeed , the artist must possess the courageous soul . ”",

And , moreover , to succeed , the artist must possess the courageous soul . ” “ What do you mean by the courageous soul ? ” “ Courageous , ma foi ! The brave soul . The soul that dares and defies . ” “ Show me the letter and play for me the Impromptu . You see that I have persistence . Does that quality count for anything in art ? ” “ It counts with a foolish old woman whom you have captivated , ” replied Mademoiselle , with her wriggling laugh . The letter was right there at hand in the drawer of the little table upon which Edna had just placed her coffee cup . Mademoiselle opened the drawer and drew forth the letter , the topmost one . She placed it in Edna 's hands , and without further comment arose and went to the piano . Mademoiselle played a soft interlude . It was an improvisation . She sat low at the instrument , and the lines of her body settled into ungraceful curves and angles that gave it an appearance of deformity . Gradually and imperceptibly the interlude melted into the soft opening minor chords of the Chopin Impromptu . Edna did not know when the Impromptu began or ended . She sat in the sofa corner reading Robert 's letter by the fading light . Mademoiselle had glided from the Chopin into the quivering love notes of Isolde 's song , and back again to the Impromptu with its soulful and poignant longing . The shadows deepened in the little room . The music grew strange and fantastic — turbulent , insistent , plaintive and soft with entreaty . The shadows grew deeper . The music filled the room . It floated out upon the night , over the housetops , the crescent of the river , losing itself in the silence of the upper air . Edna was sobbing , just as she had wept one midnight at Grand Isle when strange , new voices awoke in her . She arose in some agitation to take her departure . “ May I come again , Mademoiselle ? ” she asked at the threshold .",

His coming was in the nature of a welcome disturbance ; it seemed to furnish a new direction for her emotions . He had come to purchase a wedding gift for his daughter , Janet , and an outfit for himself in which he might make a creditable appearance at her marriage . Mr. Pontellier had selected the bridal gift , as every one immediately connected with him always deferred to his taste in such matters . And his suggestions on the question of dress — which too often assumes the nature of a problem — were of inestimable value to his father-in-law . But for the past few days the old gentleman had been upon Edna 's hands , and in his society she was becoming acquainted with a new set of sensations . He had been a colonel in the Confederate army , and still maintained , with the title , the military bearing which had always accompanied it . His hair and mustache were white and silky , emphasizing the rugged bronze of his face . He was tall and thin , and wore his coats padded , which gave a fictitious breadth and depth to his shoulders and chest . Edna and her father looked very distinguished together , and excited a good deal of notice during their perambulations . Upon his arrival she began by introducing him to her atelier and making a sketch of him . He took the whole matter very seriously . If her talent had been ten-fold greater than it was , it would not have surprised him , convinced as he was that he had bequeathed to all of his daughters the germs of a masterful capability , which only depended upon their own efforts to be directed toward successful achievement .",

        "context": "“ Pontellier , ” said the Doctor , after a moment 's reflection , “ let your wife alone for a while . Do n't bother her , and do n't let her bother you . Woman , my dear friend , is a very peculiar and delicate organism — a sensitive and highly organized woman , such as I know Mrs. Pontellier to be , is especially peculiar . It would require an inspired psychologist to deal successfully with them . And when ordinary fellows like you and me attempt to cope with their idiosyncrasies the result is bungling . Most women are moody and whimsical . This is some passing whim of your wife , due to some cause or causes which you and I need n't try to fathom . But it will pass happily over , especially if you let her alone . Send her around to see me . ” “ Oh ! I could n't do that ; there 'd be no reason for it , ” objected Mr. Pontellier . “ Then I 'll go around and see her , ” said the Doctor . “ I 'll drop in to dinner some evening en bon ami . “ Do ! by all means , ” urged Mr. Pontellier . “ What evening will you come ? Say Thursday . Will you come Thursday ? ” he asked , rising to take his leave . “ Very well ; Thursday . My wife may possibly have some engagement for me Thursday . In case she has , I shall let you know . Otherwise , you may expect me . ” Mr. Pontellier turned before leaving to say : “ I am going to New York on business very soon . I have a big scheme on hand , and want to be on the field proper to pull the ropes and handle the ribbons . We 'll let you in on the inside if you say so , Doctor , ” he laughed . “ No , I thank you , my dear sir , ” returned the Doctor . “ I leave such ventures to you younger men with the fever of life still in your blood . ” “ What I wanted to say , ” continued Mr. Pontellier , with his hand on the knob ; “ I may have to be absent a good while . Would you advise me to take Edna along ? ” “ By all means , if she wishes to go . If not , leave her here . Do n't contradict her . The mood will pass , I assure you . It may take a month , two , three months — possibly longer , but it will pass ; have patience . ” “ Well , good-by , a jeudi , ” said Mr. Pontellier , as he let himself out . The Doctor would have liked during the course of conversation to ask , “ Is there any man in the case ? ” but he knew his Creole too well to make such a blunder as that . He did not resume his book immediately , but sat for a while meditatively looking out into the garden . Edna 's father was in the city , and had been with them several days . She was not very warmly or deeply attached to him , but they had certain tastes in common , and when together they were companionable . His coming was in the nature of a welcome disturbance ; it seemed to furnish a new direction for her emotions . He had come to purchase a wedding gift for his daughter , Janet , and an outfit for himself in which he might make a creditable appearance at her marriage . Mr. Pontellier had selected the bridal gift , as every one immediately connected with him always deferred to his taste in such matters . And his suggestions on the question of dress — which too often assumes the nature of a problem — were of inestimable value to his father-in-law . But for the past few days the old gentleman had been upon Edna 's hands , and in his society she was becoming acquainted with a new set of sensations . He had been a colonel in the Confederate army , and still maintained , with the title , the military bearing which had always accompanied it . His hair and mustache were white and silky , emphasizing the rugged bronze of his face . He was tall and thin , and wore his coats padded , which gave a fictitious breadth and depth to his shoulders and chest . Edna and her father looked very distinguished together , and excited a good deal of notice during their perambulations . Upon his arrival she began by introducing him to her atelier and making a sketch of him . He took the whole matter very seriously . If her talent had been ten-fold greater than it was , it would not have surprised him , convinced as he was that he had bequeathed to all of his daughters the germs of a masterful capability , which only depended upon their own efforts to be directed toward successful achievement .",

He considered them bourgeois , and found more diversion at the club . To Madame Ratignolle he said the music dispensed at her soirees was too “ heavy , ” too far beyond his untrained comprehension . His excuse flattered her . But she disapproved of Mr. Pontellier 's club , and she was frank enough to tell Edna so . “ It 's a pity Mr. Pontellier does n't stay home more in the evenings . I think you would be more — well , if you do n't mind my saying it — more united , if he did . ” “ Oh ! dear no ! ” said Edna , with a blank look in her eyes . “ What should I do if he stayed home ? We would n't have anything to say to each other . ” She had not much of anything to say to her father , for that matter ; but he did not antagonize her . She discovered that he interested her , though she realized that he might not interest her long ; and for the first time in her life she felt as if she were thoroughly acquainted with him . He kept her busy serving him and ministering to his wants . It amused her to do so . She would not permit a servant or one of the children to do anything for him which she might do herself . Her husband noticed , and thought it was the expression of a deep filial attachment which he had never suspected . The Colonel drank numerous “ toddies ” during the course of the day , which left him , however , imperturbed . He was an expert at concocting strong drinks . He had even invented some , to which he had given fantastic names , and for whose manufacture he required diverse ingredients that it devolved upon Edna to procure for him . When Doctor Mandelet dined with the Pontelliers on Thursday he could discern in Mrs. Pontellier no trace of that morbid condition which her husband had reported to him . She was excited and in a manner radiant . She and her father had been to the race course , and their thoughts when they seated themselves at table were still occupied with the events of the afternoon , and their talk was still of the track . The Doctor had not kept pace with turf affairs . He had certain recollections of racing in what he called “ the good old times ” when the Lecompte stables flourished , and he drew upon this fund of memories so that he might not be left out and seem wholly devoid of the modern spirit . But he failed to impose upon the Colonel , and was even far from impressing him with this trumped-up knowledge of bygone days . Edna had staked her father on his last venture , with the most gratifying results to both of them . Besides , they had met some very charming people , according to the Colonel 's impressions . Mrs. Mortimer Merriman and Mrs. James Highcamp , who were there with Alcee Arobin , had joined them and had enlivened the hours in a fashion that warmed him to think of .",

She rummaged in the larder and brought forth a slice of Gruyere and some crackers . She opened a bottle of beer which she found in the icebox . Edna felt extremely restless and excited . She vacantly hummed a fantastic tune as she poked at the wood embers on the hearth and munched a cracker . She wanted something to happen — something , anything ; she did not know what . She regretted that she had not made Arobin stay a half hour to talk over the horses with her . She counted the money she had won . But there was nothing else to do , so she went to bed , and tossed there for hours in a sort of monotonous agitation . In the middle of the night she remembered that she had forgotten to write her regular letter to her husband ; and she decided to do so next day and tell him about her afternoon at the Jockey Club . She lay wide awake composing a letter which was nothing like the one which she wrote next day . When the maid awoke her in the morning Edna was dreaming of Mr. Highcamp playing the piano at the entrance of a music store on Canal Street , while his wife was saying to Alcee Arobin , as they boarded an Esplanade Street car : “ What a pity that so much talent has been neglected ! but I must go . ” When , a few days later , Alcee Arobin again called for Edna in his drag , Mrs. Highcamp was not with him . He said they would pick her up . But as that lady had not been apprised of his intention of picking her up , she was not at home . The daughter was just leaving the house to attend the meeting of a branch Folk Lore Society , and regretted that she could not accompany them . Arobin appeared nonplused , and asked Edna if there were any one else she cared to ask . She did not deem it worth while to go in search of any of the fashionable acquaintances from whom she had withdrawn herself . She thought of Madame Ratignolle , but knew that her fair friend did not leave the house , except to take a languid walk around the block with her husband after nightfall . Mademoiselle Reisz would have laughed at such a request from Edna . Madame Lebrun might have enjoyed the outing , but for some reason Edna did not want her . So they went alone , she and Arobin . The afternoon was intensely interesting to her . The excitement came back upon her like a remittent fever . Her talk grew familiar and confidential . It was no labor to become intimate with Arobin . His manner invited easy confidence . The preliminary stage of becoming acquainted was one which he always endeavored to ignore when a pretty and engaging woman was concerned .",

It was then , in the presence of that personality which was offensive to her , that the woman , by her divine art , seemed to reach Edna 's spirit and set it free . It was misty , with heavy , lowering atmosphere , one afternoon , when Edna climbed the stairs to the pianist 's apartments under the roof . Her clothes were dripping with moisture . She felt chilled and pinched as she entered the room . Mademoiselle was poking at a rusty stove that smoked a little and warmed the room indifferently . She was endeavoring to heat a pot of chocolate on the stove . The room looked cheerless and dingy to Edna as she entered . A bust of Beethoven , covered with a hood of dust , scowled at her from the mantelpiece . “ Ah ! here comes the sunlight ! ” exclaimed Mademoiselle , rising from her knees before the stove . “ Now it will be warm and bright enough ; I can let the fire alone . ” She closed the stove door with a bang , and approaching , assisted in removing Edna 's dripping mackintosh . “ You are cold ; you look miserable . The chocolate will soon be hot . But would you rather have a taste of brandy ? I have scarcely touched the bottle which you brought me for my cold . ” A piece of red flannel was wrapped around Mademoiselle 's throat ; a stiff neck compelled her to hold her head on one side . “ I will take some brandy , ” said Edna , shivering as she removed her gloves and overshoes .

It looks so cozy , so inviting and restful , whenever I pass by ; and it 's for rent . I 'm tired looking after that big house . It never seemed like mine , anyway — like home . It 's too much trouble . I have to keep too many servants . I am tired bothering with them . ”",

        "context": "“ If I were young and in love with a man , ” said Mademoiselle , turning on the stool and pressing her wiry hands between her knees as she looked down at Edna , who sat on the floor holding the letter , “ it seems to me he would have to be some grand esprit ; a man with lofty aims and ability to reach them ; one who stood high enough to attract the notice of his fellow-men . It seems to me if I were young and in love I should never deem a man of ordinary caliber worthy of my devotion . ” “ Now it is you who are telling lies and seeking to deceive me , Mademoiselle ; or else you have never been in love , and know nothing about it . Why , ” went on Edna , clasping her knees and looking up into Mademoiselle 's twisted face , “ do you suppose a woman knows why she loves ? Does she select ? Does she say to herself : ‘ Go to ! Here is a distinguished statesman with presidential possibilities ; I shall proceed to fall in love with him . ’ Or , ‘ I shall set my heart upon this musician , whose fame is on every tongue ? ’ Or , ‘ This financier , who controls the world 's money markets ? ’ “ You are purposely misunderstanding me , ma reine . Are you in love with Robert ? ” “ Yes , ” said Edna . It was the first time she had admitted it , and a glow overspread her face , blotching it with red spots . “ Why ? ” asked her companion . “ Why do you love him when you ought not to ? ” Edna , with a motion or two , dragged herself on her knees before Mademoiselle Reisz , who took the glowing face between her two hands . “ Why ? Because his hair is brown and grows away from his temples ; because he opens and shuts his eyes , and his nose is a little out of drawing ; because he has two lips and a square chin , and a little finger which he can n't straighten from having played baseball too energetically in his youth . Because — ” “ Because you do , in short , ” laughed Mademoiselle . “ What will you do when he comes back ? ” she asked . “ Do ? Nothing , except feel glad and happy to be alive . ” She was already glad and happy to be alive at the mere thought of his return . The murky , lowering sky , which had depressed her a few hours before , seemed bracing and invigorating as she splashed through the streets on her way home . She stopped at a confectioner 's and ordered a huge box of bonbons for the children in Iberville . She slipped a card in the box , on which she scribbled a tender message and sent an abundance of kisses . Before dinner in the evening Edna wrote a charming letter to her husband , telling him of her intention to move for a while into the little house around the block , and to give a farewell dinner before leaving , regretting that he was not there to share it , to help out with the menu and assist her in entertaining the guests . Her letter was brilliant and brimming with cheerfulness .",

The murky , lowering sky , which had depressed her a few hours before , seemed bracing and invigorating as she splashed through the streets on her way home . She stopped at a confectioner 's and ordered a huge box of bonbons for the children in Iberville . She slipped a card in the box , on which she scribbled a tender message and sent an abundance of kisses . Before dinner in the evening Edna wrote a charming letter to her husband , telling him of her intention to move for a while into the little house around the block , and to give a farewell dinner before leaving , regretting that he was not there to share it , to help out with the menu and assist her in entertaining the guests . Her letter was brilliant and brimming with cheerfulness . “ What is the matter with you ? ” asked Arobin that evening . “ I never found you in such a happy mood . ” Edna was tired by that time , and was reclining on the lounge before the fire . “ Do n't you know the weather prophet has told us we shall see the sun pretty soon ? ” “ Well , that ought to be reason enough , ” he acquiesced . “ You would n't give me another if I sat here all night imploring you . ” He sat close to her on a low tabouret , and as he spoke his fingers lightly touched the hair that fell a little over her forehead . She liked the touch of his fingers through her hair , and closed her eyes sensitively . “ One of these days , ” she said , “ I 'm going to pull myself together for a while and think — try to determine what character of a woman I am ; for , candidly , I do n't know . By all the codes which I am acquainted with , I am a devilishly wicked specimen of the sex . But some way I can n't convince myself that I am . I must think about it . ” “ Do n't . What 's the use ? Why should you bother thinking about it when I can tell you what manner of woman you are . ” His fingers strayed occasionally down to her warm , smooth cheeks and firm chin , which was growing a little full and double . “ Oh , yes ! You will tell me that I am adorable ; everything that is captivating . Spare yourself the effort . ” “ No ; I sha n't tell you anything of the sort , though I should n't be lying if I did . ” “ Do you know Mademoiselle Reisz ? ” she asked irrelevantly . “ The pianist ? I know her by sight . I 've heard her play . ”",

There was her husband 's reproach looking at her from the external things around her which he had provided for her external existence . There was Robert 's reproach making itself felt by a quicker , fiercer , more overpowering love , which had awakened within her toward him . Above all , there was understanding . She felt as if a mist had been lifted from her eyes , enabling her to took upon and comprehend the significance of life , that monster made up of beauty and brutality . But among the conflicting sensations which assailed her , there was neither shame nor remorse . There was a dull pang of regret because it was not the kiss of love which had inflamed her , because it was not love which had held this cup of life to her lips .",

Edna herself made the tenth , and at half-past eight they seated themselves at table , Arobin and Monsieur Ratignolle on either side of their hostess . Mrs. Highcamp sat between Arobin and Victor Lebrun . Then came Mrs. Merriman , Mr. Gouvernail , Miss Mayblunt , Mr. Merriman , and Mademoiselle Reisz next to Monsieur Ratignolle . There was something extremely gorgeous about the appearance of the table , an effect of splendor conveyed by a cover of pale yellow satin under strips of lace-work . There were wax candles , in massive brass candelabra , burning softly under yellow silk shades ; full , fragrant roses , yellow and red , abounded . There were silver and gold , as she had said there would be , and crystal which glittered like the gems which the women wore . The ordinary stiff dining chairs had been discarded for the occasion and replaced by the most commodious and luxurious which could be collected throughout the house . Mademoiselle Reisz , being exceedingly diminutive , was elevated upon cushions , as small children are sometimes hoisted at table upon bulky volumes . “ Something new , Edna ? ” exclaimed Miss Mayblunt , with lorgnette directed toward a magnificent cluster of diamonds that sparkled , that almost sputtered , in Edna 's hair , just over the center of her forehead . “ Quite new ; ‘ brand ’ new , in fact ; a present from my husband . It arrived this morning from New York . I may as well admit that this is my birthday , and that I am twenty-nine . In good time I expect you to drink my health . Meanwhile , I shall ask you to begin with this cocktail , composed — would you say ‘ composed ? ’ ” with an appeal to Miss Mayblunt — “ composed by my father in honor of Sister Janet 's wedding . ” Before each guest stood a tiny glass that looked and sparkled like a garnet gem . “ Then , all things considered , ” spoke Arobin , “ it might not be amiss to start out by drinking the Colonel 's health in the cocktail which he composed , on the birthday of the most charming of women — the daughter whom he invented . ” Mr. Merriman 's laugh at this sally was such a genuine outburst and so contagious that it started the dinner with an agreeable swing that never slackened . Miss Mayblunt begged to be allowed to keep her cocktail untouched before her , just to look at . The color was marvelous ! She could compare it to nothing she had ever seen , and the garnet lights which it emitted were unspeakably rare . She pronounced the Colonel an artist , and stuck to it .",

It was the color of her skin , without the glow , the myriad living tints that one may sometimes discover in vibrant flesh . There was something in her attitude , in her whole appearance when she leaned her head against the high-backed chair and spread her arms , which suggested the regal woman , the one who rules , who looks on , who stands alone . But as she sat there amid her guests , she felt the old ennui overtaking her ; the hopelessness which so often assailed her , which came upon her like an obsession , like something extraneous , independent of volition . It was something which announced itself ; a chill breath that seemed to issue from some vast cavern wherein discords waited . There came over her the acute longing which always summoned into her spiritual vision the presence of the beloved one , overpowering her at once with a sense of the unattainable . The moments glided on , while a feeling of good fellowship passed around the circle like a mystic cord , holding and binding these people together with jest and laughter . Monsieur Ratignolle was the first to break the pleasant charm . At ten o'clock he excused himself . Madame Ratignolle was waiting for him at home . She was bien souffrante , and she was filled with vague dread , which only her husband 's presence could allay . Mademoiselle Reisz arose with Monsieur Ratignolle , who offered to escort her to the car . She had eaten well ; she had tasted the good , rich wines , and they must have turned her head , for she bowed pleasantly to all as she withdrew from table . She kissed Edna upon the shoulder , and whispered : “ Bonne nuit , ma reine ; soyez sage . ” She had been a little bewildered upon rising , or rather , descending from her cushions , and Monsieur Ratignolle gallantly took her arm and led her away . Mrs. Highcamp was weaving a garland of roses , yellow and red . When she had finished the garland , she laid it lightly upon Victor 's black curls . He was reclining far back in the luxurious chair , holding a glass of champagne to the light . As if a magician 's wand had touched him , the garland of roses transformed him into a vision of Oriental beauty . His cheeks were the color of crushed grapes , and his dusky eyes glowed with a languishing fire . “ Sapristi ! ” exclaimed Arobin . But Mrs. Highcamp had one more touch to add to the picture . She took from the back of her chair a white silken scarf , with which she had covered her shoulders in the early part of the evening . She draped it across the boy in graceful folds , and in a way to conceal his black , conventional evening dress . He did not seem to mind what she did to him , only smiled , showing a faint gleam of white teeth , while he continued to gaze with narrowing eyes at the light through his glass of champagne .",

He did not seem to mind what she did to him , only smiled , showing a faint gleam of white teeth , while he continued to gaze with narrowing eyes at the light through his glass of champagne . “ Oh ! to be able to paint in color rather than in words ! ” exclaimed Miss Mayblunt , losing herself in a rhapsodic dream as she looked at him . “ ‘ There was a graven image of Desire Painted with red blood on a ground of gold . ’ ” murmured Gouvernail , under his breath . The effect of the wine upon Victor was to change his accustomed volubility into silence . He seemed to have abandoned himself to a reverie , and to be seeing pleasing visions in the amber bead . “ Sing , ” entreated Mrs. Highcamp . “ Wo n't you sing to us ? ” “ Let him alone , ” said Arobin . “ He 's posing , ” offered Mr. Merriman ; “ let him have it out . ” “ I believe he 's paralyzed , ” laughed Mrs. Merriman . And leaning over the youth 's chair , she took the glass from his hand and held it to his lips . He sipped the wine slowly , and when he had drained the glass she laid it upon the table and wiped his lips with her little filmy handkerchief . “ Yes , I 'll sing for you , ” he said , turning in his chair toward Mrs. Highcamp . He clasped his hands behind his head , and looking up at the ceiling began to hum a little , trying his voice like a musician tuning an instrument . Then , looking at Edna , he began to sing : “ Ah ! si tu savais ! ” “ Stop ! ” she cried , “ do n't sing that . I do n't want you to sing it , ” and she laid her glass so impetuously and blindly upon the table as to shatter it against a carafe . The wine spilled over Arobin 's legs and some of it trickled down upon Mrs. Highcamp 's black gauze gown . Victor had lost all idea of courtesy , or else he thought his hostess was not in earnest , for he laughed and went on : “ Ah ! si tu savais Ce que tes yeux me disent “ — “ Oh ! you must n't ! you must n't , ” exclaimed Edna , and pushing back her chair she got up , and going behind him placed her hand over his mouth . He kissed the soft palm that pressed upon his lips . “ No , no , I wo n't , Mrs. Pontellier . I did n't know you meant it , ” looking up at her with caressing eyes . The touch of his lips was like a pleasing sting to her hand . She lifted the garland of roses from his head and flung it across the room . “ Come , Victor ; you 've posed long enough . Give Mrs. Highcamp her scarf . ”",

The mandolin players had long since stolen away . A profound stillness had fallen upon the broad , beautiful street . The voices of Edna 's disbanding guests jarred like a discordant note upon the quiet harmony of the night . “ Well ? ” questioned Arobin , who had remained with Edna after the others had departed . “ Well , ” she reiterated , and stood up , stretching her arms , and feeling the need to relax her muscles after having been so long seated . “ What next ? ” he asked . “ The servants are all gone . They left when the musicians did . I have dismissed them . The house has to be closed and locked , and I shall trot around to the pigeon house , and shall send Celestine over in the morning to straighten things up . ” He looked around , and began to turn out some of the lights . “ What about upstairs ? ” he inquired . “ I think it is all right ; but there may be a window or two unlatched . We had better look ; you might take a candle and see . And bring me my wrap and hat on the foot of the bed in the middle room . ” He went up with the light , and Edna began closing doors and windows . She hated to shut in the smoke and the fumes of the wine . Arobin found her cape and hat , which he brought down and helped her to put on . When everything was secured and the lights put out , they left through the front door , Arobin locking it and taking the key , which he carried for Edna . He helped her down the steps .",

Arobin had sent them , and had had Celestine distribute them during Edna 's absence . Her bedroom was adjoining , and across a small passage were the diningroom and kitchen . Edna seated herself with every appearance of discomfort . “ Are you tired ? ” he asked . “ Yes , and chilled , and miserable . I feel as if I had been wound up to a certain pitch — too tight — and something inside of me had snapped . ” She rested her head against the table upon her bare arm . “ You want to rest , ” he said , “ and to be quiet . I 'll go ; I 'll leave you and let you rest . ” “ Yes , ” she replied . He stood up beside her and smoothed her hair with his soft , magnetic hand . His touch conveyed to her a certain physical comfort . She could have fallen quietly asleep there if he had continued to pass his hand over her hair . He brushed the hair upward from the nape of her neck . “ I hope you will feel better and happier in the morning , ” he said . “ You have tried to do too much in the past few days . The dinner was the last straw ; you might have dispensed with it . ” “ Yes , ” she admitted ; “ it was stupid . ” “ No , it was delightful ; but it has worn you out . ” His hand had strayed to her beautiful shoulders , and he could feel the response of her flesh to his touch . He seated himself beside her and kissed her lightly upon the shoulder . “ I thought you were going away , ” she said , in an uneven voice . “ I am , after I have said good night . ” “ Good night , ” she murmured . He did not answer , except to continue to caress her . He did not say good night until she had become supple to his gentle , seductive entreaties . When Mr. Pontellier learned of his wife 's intention to abandon her home and take up her residence elsewhere , he immediately wrote her a letter of unqualified disapproval and remonstrance . She had given reasons which he was unwilling to acknowledge as adequate . He hoped she had not acted upon her rash impulse ; and he begged her to consider first , foremost , and above all else , what people would say . He was not dreaming of scandal when he uttered this warning ; that was a thing which would never have entered into his mind to consider in connection with his wife 's name or his own . He was simply thinking of his financial integrity . It might get noised about that the Pontelliers had met with reverses , and were forced to conduct their menage on a humbler scale than heretofore . It might do incalculable mischief to his business prospects .",

The same mail which brought to Edna his letter of disapproval carried instructions — the most minute instructions — to a well-known architect concerning the remodeling of his home , changes which he had long contemplated , and which he desired carried forward during his temporary absence .",

        "context": "Madame Ratignolle had dragged herself over , avoiding the too public thoroughfares , she said . She complained that Edna had neglected her much of late . Besides , she was consumed with curiosity to see the little house and the manner in which it was conducted . She wanted to hear all about the dinner party ; Monsieur Ratignolle had left so early . What had happened after he left ? The champagne and grapes which Edna sent over were TOO delicious . She had so little appetite ; they had refreshed and toned her stomach . Where on earth was she going to put Mr. Pontellier in that little house , and the boys ? And then she made Edna promise to go to her when her hour of trial overtook her . “ At any time — any time of the day or night , dear , ” Edna assured her . Before leaving Madame Ratignolle said : “ In some way you seem to me like a child , Edna . You seem to act without a certain amount of reflection which is necessary in this life . That is the reason I want to say you must n't mind if I advise you to be a little careful while you are living here alone . Why do n't you have some one come and stay with you ? Would n't Mademoiselle Reisz come ? ” “ No ; she would n't wish to come , and I should n't want her always with me . ” “ Well , the reason — you know how evil-minded the world is — some one was talking of Alcee Arobin visiting you . Of course , it would n't matter if Mr. Arobin had not such a dreadful reputation . Monsieur Ratignolle was telling me that his attentions alone are considered enough to ruin a woman s name . ” “ Does he boast of his successes ? ” asked Edna , indifferently , squinting at her picture . “ No , I think not . I believe he is a decent fellow as far as that goes . But his character is so well known among the men . I sha n't be able to come back and see you ; it was very , very imprudent to-day . ” “ Mind the step ! ” cried Edna . “ Do n't neglect me , ” entreated Madame Ratignolle ; “ and do n't mind what I said about Arobin , or having some one to stay with you . “ Of course not , ” Edna laughed . “ You may say anything you like to me . ” They kissed each other good-by . Madame Ratignolle had not far to go , and Edna stood on the porch a while watching her walk down the street . Then in the afternoon Mrs. Merriman and Mrs. Highcamp had made their “ party call . ” Edna felt that they might have dispensed with the formality . They had also come to invite her to play vingt-et-un one evening at Mrs. Merriman 's . She was asked to go early , to dinner , and Mr. Merriman or Mr. Arobin would take her home . Edna accepted in a half-hearted way . She sometimes felt very tired of Mrs. Highcamp and Mrs. Merriman . Late in the afternoon she sought refuge with Mademoiselle Reisz , and stayed there alone , waiting for her , feeling a kind of repose invade her with the very atmosphere of the shabby , unpretentious little room . Edna sat at the window , which looked out over the house-tops and across the river . The window frame was filled with pots of flowers , and she sat and picked the dry leaves from a rose geranium . The day was warm , and the breeze which blew from the river was very pleasant . She removed her hat and laid it on the piano . She went on picking the leaves and digging around the plants with her hat pin . Once she thought she heard Mademoiselle Reisz approaching . But it was a young black girl , who came in , bringing a small bundle of laundry , which she deposited in the adjoining room , and went away .",

Then in the afternoon Mrs. Merriman and Mrs. Highcamp had made their “ party call . ” Edna felt that they might have dispensed with the formality . They had also come to invite her to play vingt-et-un one evening at Mrs. Merriman 's . She was asked to go early , to dinner , and Mr. Merriman or Mr. Arobin would take her home . Edna accepted in a half-hearted way . She sometimes felt very tired of Mrs. Highcamp and Mrs. Merriman . Late in the afternoon she sought refuge with Mademoiselle Reisz , and stayed there alone , waiting for her , feeling a kind of repose invade her with the very atmosphere of the shabby , unpretentious little room . Edna sat at the window , which looked out over the house-tops and across the river . The window frame was filled with pots of flowers , and she sat and picked the dry leaves from a rose geranium . The day was warm , and the breeze which blew from the river was very pleasant . She removed her hat and laid it on the piano . She went on picking the leaves and digging around the plants with her hat pin . Once she thought she heard Mademoiselle Reisz approaching . But it was a young black girl , who came in , bringing a small bundle of laundry , which she deposited in the adjoining room , and went away .",

How do you happen — oh ! how well you look ! Is Mademoiselle Reisz not here ?

She remembered the day she sat on the floor , turning the pages of his letter , seeking the reason which was left untold . She had not noticed how he looked — only feeling his presence ; but she turned deliberately and observed him . After all , he had been absent but a few months , and was not changed . His hair — the color of hers — waved back from his temples in the same way as before . His skin was not more burned than it had been at Grand Isle . She found in his eyes , when he looked at her for one silent moment , the same tender caress , with an added warmth and entreaty which had not been there before the same glance which had penetrated to the sleeping places of her soul and awakened them .",

It would be a fine night to drive . ” “ No ; I do n't want to do anything but just be quiet . You go away and amuse yourself . Do n't stay . ” “ I 'll go away if I must ; but I sha n't amuse myself . You know that I only live when I am near you . ” He stood up to bid her good night . “ Is that one of the things you always say to women ? ” “ I have said it before , but I do n't think I ever came so near meaning it , ” he answered with a smile . There were no warm lights in her eyes ; only a dreamy , absent look . “ Good night . I adore you . Sleep well , ” he said , and he kissed her hand and went away .

She recalled his words , his looks . How few and meager they had been for her hungry heart ! A vision — a transcendently seductive vision of a Mexican girl arose before her . She writhed with a jealous pang . She wondered when he would come back . He had not said he would come back . She had been with him , had heard his voice and touched his hand . But some way he had seemed nearer to her off there in Mexico .",

        "context": "There was a garden out in the suburbs ; a small , leafy corner , with a few green tables under the orange trees . An old cat slept all day on the stone step in the sun , and an old mulatresse slept her idle hours away in her chair at the open window , till , some one happened to knock on one of the green tables . She had milk and cream cheese to sell , and bread and butter . There was no one who could make such excellent coffee or fry a chicken so golden brown as she . The place was too modest to attract the attention of people of fashion , and so quiet as to have escaped the notice of those in search of pleasure and dissipation . Edna had discovered it accidentally one day when the high-board gate stood ajar . She caught sight of a little green table , blotched with the checkered sunlight that filtered through the quivering leaves overhead . Within she had found the slumbering mulatresse , the drowsy cat , and a glass of milk which reminded her of the milk she had tasted in Iberville . She often stopped there during her perambulations ; sometimes taking a book with her , and sitting an hour or two under the trees when she found the place deserted . Once or twice she took a quiet dinner there alone , having instructed Celestine beforehand to prepare no dinner at home . It was the last place in the city where she would have expected to meet any one she knew . Still she was not astonished when , as she was partaking of a modest dinner late in the afternoon , looking into an open book , stroking the cat , which had made friends with her — she was not greatly astonished to see Robert come in at the tall garden gate . “ I am destined to see you only by accident , ” she said , shoving the cat off the chair beside her . He was surprised , ill at ease , almost embarrassed at meeting her thus so unexpectedly . “ Do you come here often ? ” he asked . “ I almost live here , ” she said . “ I used to drop in very often for a cup of Catiche 's good coffee . This is the first time since I came back . ” “ She 'll bring you a plate , and you will share my dinner . There 's always enough for two — even three . ” Edna had intended to be indifferent and as reserved as he when she met him ; she had reached the determination by a laborious train of reasoning , incident to one of her despondent moods . But her resolve melted when she saw him before designing Providence had led him into her path . “ Why have you kept away from me , Robert ? ” she asked , closing the book that lay open upon the table . “ Why are you so personal , Mrs. Pontellier ? Why do you force me to idiotic subterfuges ? ” he exclaimed with sudden warmth . “ I suppose there 's no use telling you I 've been very busy , or that I 've been sick , or that I 've been to see you and not found you at home . Please let me off with any one of these excuses . ” “ You are the embodiment of selfishness , ” she said . “ You save yourself something — I do n't know what — but there is some selfish motive , and in sparing yourself you never consider for a moment what I think , or how I feel your neglect and indifference . I suppose this is what you would call unwomanly ; but I have got into a habit of expressing myself . It does n't matter to me , and you may think me unwomanly if you like . ”",

Within she had found the slumbering mulatresse , the drowsy cat , and a glass of milk which reminded her of the milk she had tasted in Iberville . She often stopped there during her perambulations ; sometimes taking a book with her , and sitting an hour or two under the trees when she found the place deserted . Once or twice she took a quiet dinner there alone , having instructed Celestine beforehand to prepare no dinner at home . It was the last place in the city where she would have expected to meet any one she knew . Still she was not astonished when , as she was partaking of a modest dinner late in the afternoon , looking into an open book , stroking the cat , which had made friends with her — she was not greatly astonished to see Robert come in at the tall garden gate . “ I am destined to see you only by accident , ” she said , shoving the cat off the chair beside her . He was surprised , ill at ease , almost embarrassed at meeting her thus so unexpectedly . “ Do you come here often ? ” he asked . “ I almost live here , ” she said . “ I used to drop in very often for a cup of Catiche 's good coffee . This is the first time since I came back . ” “ She 'll bring you a plate , and you will share my dinner . There 's always enough for two — even three . ” Edna had intended to be indifferent and as reserved as he when she met him ; she had reached the determination by a laborious train of reasoning , incident to one of her despondent moods . But her resolve melted when she saw him before designing Providence had led him into her path . “ Why have you kept away from me , Robert ? ” she asked , closing the book that lay open upon the table . “ Why are you so personal , Mrs. Pontellier ? Why do you force me to idiotic subterfuges ? ” he exclaimed with sudden warmth . “ I suppose there 's no use telling you I 've been very busy , or that I 've been sick , or that I 've been to see you and not found you at home . Please let me off with any one of these excuses . ” “ You are the embodiment of selfishness , ” she said . “ You save yourself something — I do n't know what — but there is some selfish motive , and in sparing yourself you never consider for a moment what I think , or how I feel your neglect and indifference . I suppose this is what you would call unwomanly ; but I have got into a habit of expressing myself . It does n't matter to me , and you may think me unwomanly if you like . ”",

It was you who awoke me last summer out of a life-long , stupid dream . Oh ! you have made me so unhappy with your indifference . Oh ! I have suffered , suffered ! Now you are here we shall love each other , my Robert . We shall be everything to each other . Nothing else in the world is of any consequence . I must go to my friend ; but you will wait for me ?

        "context": "Doctor Mandelet paid no attention to Madame Ratignolle 's upbraidings . He was accustomed to them at such times , and was too well convinced of her loyalty to doubt it . He was glad to see Edna , and wanted her to go with him into the salon and entertain him . But Madame Ratignolle would not consent that Edna should leave her for an instant . Between agonizing moments , she chatted a little , and said it took her mind off her sufferings . Edna began to feel uneasy . She was seized with a vague dread . Her own like experiences seemed far away , unreal , and only half remembered . She recalled faintly an ecstasy of pain , the heavy odor of chloroform , a stupor which had deadened sensation , and an awakening to find a little new life to which she had given being , added to the great unnumbered multitude of souls that come and go . She began to wish she had not come ; her presence was not necessary . She might have invented a pretext for staying away ; she might even invent a pretext now for going . But Edna did not go . With an inward agony , with a flaming , outspoken revolt against the ways of Nature , she witnessed the scene of torture . She was still stunned and speechless with emotion when later she leaned over her friend to kiss her and softly say good-by . Adele , pressing her cheek , whispered in an exhausted voice : “ Think of the children , Edna . Oh think of the children ! Remember them ! ” Edna still felt dazed when she got outside in the open air . The Doctor 's coupe had returned for him and stood before the porte cochere . She did not wish to enter the coupe , and told Doctor Mandelet she would walk ; she was not afraid , and would go alone . He directed his carriage to meet him at Mrs. Pontellier 's , and he started to walk home with her . Up — away up , over the narrow street between the tall houses , the stars were blazing . The air was mild and caressing , but cool with the breath of spring and the night . They walked slowly , the Doctor with a heavy , measured tread and his hands behind him ; Edna , in an absent-minded way , as she had walked one night at Grand Isle , as if her thoughts had gone ahead of her and she was striving to overtake them . “ You should n't have been there , Mrs. Pontellier , ” he said . “ That was no place for you . Adele is full of whims at such times . There were a dozen women she might have had with her , unimpressionable women . I felt that it was cruel , cruel . You should n't have gone . ”",

She got it into her head that Victor was in love with Mrs. Pontellier , and he gave her evasive answers , framed so as to confirm her belief .

There were a dozen men crazy about her at the Cheniere ; and since it was the fashion to be in love with married people , why , she could run away any time she liked to New Orleans with Celina 's husband . Celina 's husband was a fool , a coward , and a pig , and to prove it to her , Victor intended to hammer his head into a jelly the next time he encountered him . This assurance was very consoling to Mariequita . She dried her eyes , and grew cheerful at the prospect . They were still talking of the dinner and the allurements of city life when Mrs. Pontellier herself slipped around the corner of the house . The two youngsters stayed dumb with amazement before what they considered to be an apparition . But it was really she in flesh and blood , looking tired and a little travel-stained . “ I walked up from the wharf ” , she said , “ and heard the hammering . I supposed it was you , mending the porch . It 's a good thing . I was always tripping over those loose planks last summer . How dreary and deserted everything looks ! ” It took Victor some little time to comprehend that she had come in Beaudelet 's lugger , that she had come alone , and for no purpose but to rest . “ There 's nothing fixed up yet , you see . I 'll give you my room ; it 's the only place . ” “ Any corner will do , ” she assured him . “ And if you can stand Philomel 's cooking , ” he went on , “ though I might try to get her mother while you are here . Do you think she would come ? ” turning to Mariequita . Mariequita thought that perhaps Philomel 's mother might come for a few days , and money enough . Beholding Mrs. Pontellier make her appearance , the girl had at once suspected a lovers ’ rendezvous . But Victor 's astonishment was so genuine , and Mrs. Pontellier 's indifference so apparent , that the disturbing notion did not lodge long in her brain . She contemplated with the greatest interest this woman who gave the most sumptuous dinners in America , and who had all the men in New Orleans at her feet . “ What time will you have dinner ? ” asked Edna . “ I 'm very hungry ; but do n't get anything extra . ”",

        "context": "Victor , with hammer and nails and scraps of scantling , was patching a corner of one of the galleries . Mariequita sat near by , dangling her legs , watching him work , and handing him nails from the tool-box . The sun was beating down upon them . The girl had covered her head with her apron folded into a square pad . They had been talking for an hour or more . She was never tired of hearing Victor describe the dinner at Mrs. Pontellier 's . He exaggerated every detail , making it appear a veritable Lucullean feast . The flowers were in tubs , he said . The champagne was quaffed from huge golden goblets . Venus rising from the foam could have presented no more entrancing a spectacle than Mrs. Pontellier , blazing with beauty and diamonds at the head of the board , while the other women were all of them youthful houris , possessed of incomparable charms . She got it into her head that Victor was in love with Mrs. Pontellier , and he gave her evasive answers , framed so as to confirm her belief . She grew sullen and cried a little , threatening to go off and leave him to his fine ladies . There were a dozen men crazy about her at the Cheniere ; and since it was the fashion to be in love with married people , why , she could run away any time she liked to New Orleans with Celina 's husband . Celina 's husband was a fool , a coward , and a pig , and to prove it to her , Victor intended to hammer his head into a jelly the next time he encountered him . This assurance was very consoling to Mariequita . She dried her eyes , and grew cheerful at the prospect . They were still talking of the dinner and the allurements of city life when Mrs. Pontellier herself slipped around the corner of the house . The two youngsters stayed dumb with amazement before what they considered to be an apparition . But it was really she in flesh and blood , looking tired and a little travel-stained . “ I walked up from the wharf ” , she said , “ and heard the hammering . I supposed it was you , mending the porch . It 's a good thing . I was always tripping over those loose planks last summer . How dreary and deserted everything looks ! ” It took Victor some little time to comprehend that she had come in Beaudelet 's lugger , that she had come alone , and for no purpose but to rest . “ There 's nothing fixed up yet , you see . I 'll give you my room ; it 's the only place . ” “ Any corner will do , ” she assured him . “ And if you can stand Philomel 's cooking , ” he went on , “ though I might try to get her mother while you are here . Do you think she would come ? ” turning to Mariequita . Mariequita thought that perhaps Philomel 's mother might come for a few days , and money enough . Beholding Mrs. Pontellier make her appearance , the girl had at once suspected a lovers ’ rendezvous . But Victor 's astonishment was so genuine , and Mrs. Pontellier 's indifference so apparent , that the disturbing notion did not lodge long in her brain . She contemplated with the greatest interest this woman who gave the most sumptuous dinners in America , and who had all the men in New Orleans at her feet . “ What time will you have dinner ? ” asked Edna . “ I 'm very hungry ; but do n't get anything extra . ”",

I was always tripping over those loose planks last summer .

How strange and awful it seemed to stand naked under the sky ! how delicious ! She felt like some new-born creature , opening its eyes in a familiar world that it had never known . The foamy wavelets curled up to her white feet , and coiled like serpents about her ankles . She walked out . The water was chill , but she walked on . The water was deep , but she lifted her white body and reached out with a long , sweeping stroke . The touch of the sea is sensuous , enfolding the body in its soft , close embrace . She went on and on . She remembered the night she swam far out , and recalled the terror that seized her at the fear of being unable to regain the shore . She did not look back now , but went on and on , thinking of the blue-grass meadow that she had traversed when a little child , believing that it had no beginning and no end . Her arms and legs were growing tired . She thought of Leonce and the children . They were a part of her life . But they need not have thought that they could possess her , body and soul .

She heard the barking of an old dog that was chained to the sycamore tree . The spurs of the cavalry officer clanged as he walked across the porch . There was the hum of bees , and the musky odor of pinks filled the air . She was now a large , gaunt black woman , past thirty-five .

The baby was beside her , upon her arm , where he had fallen asleep , at her breast . The yellow nurse woman sat beside a window fanning herself . Madame Valmonde bent her portly figure over Desiree and kissed her , holding her an instant tenderly in her arms . Then she turned to the child . “ This is not the baby ! ” she exclaimed , in startled tones . French was the language spoken at Valmonde in those days . “ I knew you would be astonished , ” laughed Desiree , “ at the way he has grown . The little cochon de lait ! Look at his legs , mamma , and his hands and fingernails ,— real finger-nails . Zandrine had to cut them this morning . Is n't it true , Zandrine ? ” The woman bowed her turbaned head majestically , “ Mais si , Madame . ” “ And the way he cries , ” went on Desiree , “ is deafening . Armand heard him the other day as far away as La Blanche 's cabin . ” Madame Valmonde had never removed her eyes from the child . She lifted it and walked with it over to the window that was lightest . She scanned the baby narrowly , then looked as searchingly at Zandrine , whose face was turned to gaze across the fields . “ Yes , the child has grown , has changed , ” said Madame Valmonde , slowly , as she replaced it beside its mother . “ What does Armand say ? ” Desiree 's face became suffused with a glow that was happiness itself . “ Oh , Armand is the proudest father in the parish , I believe , chiefly because it is a boy , to bear his name ; though he says not ,— that he would have loved a girl as well . But I know it is n't true . I know he says that to please me . And mamma , ” she added , drawing Madame Valmonde 's head down to her , and speaking in a whisper , “ he has n't punished one of them — not one of them — since baby is born . Even Negrillon , who pretended to have burnt his leg that he might rest from work — he only laughed , and said Negrillon was a great scamp . Oh , mamma , I 'm so happy ; it frightens me . ” What Desiree said was true . Marriage , and later the birth of his son had softened Armand Aubigny 's imperious and exacting nature greatly . This was what made the gentle Desiree so happy , for she loved him desperately . When he frowned she trembled , but loved him . When he smiled , she asked no greater blessing of God . But Armand 's dark , handsome face had not often been disfigured by frowns since the day he fell in love with her .",

I should like him better if he did ; if he were more like others , and I had to plan somewhat for his comfort and enjoyment . ” Gaston took his wife 's pretty face between his hands and looked tenderly and laughingly into her troubled eyes . They were making a bit of toilet sociably together in Mrs. Baroda 's dressing-room . “ You are full of surprises , ma belle , ” he said to her . “ Even I can never count upon how you are going to act under given conditions . ” He kissed her and turned to fasten his cravat before the mirror . “ Here you are , ” he went on , “ taking poor Gouvernail seriously and making a commotion over him , the last thing he would desire or expect . ” “ Commotion ! ” she hotly resented . “ Nonsense ! How can you say such a thing ? Commotion , indeed ! But , you know , you said he was clever . ” “ So he is . But the poor fellow is run down by overwork now . That 's why I asked him here to take a rest . ” “ You used to say he was a man of ideas , ” she retorted , unconciliated . “ I expected him to be interesting , at least .

Let me know when Mr. Gouvernail is gone ; I shall be at my Aunt Octavie 's . ” That night she went and sat alone upon a bench that stood beneath a live oak tree at the edge of the gravel walk . She had never known her thoughts or her intentions to be so confused . She could gather nothing from them but the feeling of a distinct necessity to quit her home in the morning . Mrs. Baroda heard footsteps crunching the gravel ; but could discern in the darkness only the approaching red point of a lighted cigar . She knew it was Gouvernail , for her husband did not smoke . She hoped to remain unnoticed , but her white gown revealed her to him . He threw away his cigar and seated himself upon the bench beside her ; without a suspicion that she might object to his presence .",

She wanted to draw close to him and whisper against his cheek — she did not care what — as she might have done if she had not been a respectable woman . The stronger the impulse grew to bring herself near him , the further , in fact , did she draw away from him . As soon as she could do so without an appearance of too great rudeness , she rose and left him there alone . Before she reached the house , Gouvernail had lighted a fresh cigar and ended his apostrophe to the night . Mrs. Baroda was greatly tempted that night to tell her husband — who was also her friend — of this folly that had seized her . But she did not yield to the temptation . Beside being a respectable woman she was a very sensible one ; and she knew there are some battles in life which a human being must fight alone . When Gaston arose in the morning , his wife had already departed . She had taken an early morning train to the city . She did not return till Gouvernail was gone from under her roof . There was some talk of having him back during the summer that followed . That is , Gaston greatly desired it ; but this desire yielded to his wife 's strenuous opposition . However , before the year ended , she proposed , wholly from herself , to have Gouvernail visit them again . Her husband was surprised and delighted with the suggestion coming from her . “ I am glad , chere amie , to know that you have finally overcome your dislike for him ; truly he did not deserve it . ” “ Oh , ” she told him , laughingly , after pressing a long , tender kiss upon his lips , “ I have overcome everything ! you will see . This time I shall be very nice to him . ” Brantain sat in one of these shadows ; it had overtaken him and he did not mind . The obscurity lent him courage to keep his eyes fastened as ardently as he liked upon the girl who sat in the firelight . She was very handsome , with a certain fine , rich coloring that belongs to the healthy brune type . She was quite composed , as she idly stroked the satiny coat of the cat that lay curled in her lap , and she occasionally sent a slow glance into the shadow where her companion sat . They were talking low , of indifferent things which plainly were not the things that occupied their thoughts . She knew that he loved her — a frank , blustering fellow without guile enough to conceal his feelings , and no desire to do so . For two weeks past he had sought her society eagerly and persistently . She was confidently waiting for him to declare himself and she meant to accept him . The rather insignificant and unattractive Brantain was enormously rich ; and she liked and required the entourage which wealth could give her .",

Already she gave herself a little demure air like her Aunt Tavie . She walked with a slow glide in unconscious imitation of Mademoiselle Tavie whom some youthful affliction had robbed of earthly compensation while leaving her in possession of youth 's illusions . As she sat in the old cabriolet beside the father of her dead lover , again there came to Octavie the terrible sense of loss which had assailed her so often before . The soul of her youth clamored for its rights ; for a share in the world 's glory and exultation . She leaned back and drew her veil a little closer about her face . It was an old black veil of her Aunt Tavie 's . A whiff of dust from the road had blown in and she wiped her cheeks and her eyes with her soft , white handkerchief , a homemade handkerchief , fabricated from one of her old fine muslin petticoats . “ Will you do me the favor , Octavie , ” requested the judge in the courteous tone which he never abandoned , “ to remove that veil which you wear . It seems out of harmony , someway , with the beauty and promise of the day . ” The young girl obediently yielded to her old companion 's wish and unpinning the cumbersome , sombre drapery from her bonnet , folded it neatly and laid it upon the seat in front of her . “ Ah ! that is better ; far better ! ” he said in a tone expressing unbounded relief . “ Never put it on again , dear . ” Octavie felt a little hurt ; as if he wished to debar her from share and parcel in the burden of affliction which had been placed upon all of them . Again she drew forth the old muslin handkerchief . They had left the big road and turned into a level plain which had formerly been an old meadow . There were clumps of thorn trees here and there , gorgeous in their spring radiance . Some cattle were grazing off in the distance in spots where the grass was tall and luscious . At the far end of the meadow was the towering lilac hedge , skirting the lane that led to Judge Pillier 's house , and the scent of its heavy blossoms met them like a soft and tender embrace of welcome . As they neared the house the old gentleman placed an arm around the girl 's shoulders and turning her face up to him he said : “ Do you not think that on a day like this , miracles might happen ? When the whole earth is vibrant with life , does it not seem to you , Octavie , that heaven might for once relent and give us back our dead ? ” He spoke very low , advisedly , and impressively . In his voice was an old quaver which was not habitual and there was agitation in every line of his visage . She gazed at him with eyes that were full of supplication and a certain terror of joy .",

A whiff of dust from the road had blown in and she wiped her cheeks and her eyes with her soft , white handkerchief , a homemade handkerchief , fabricated from one of her old fine muslin petticoats . “ Will you do me the favor , Octavie , ” requested the judge in the courteous tone which he never abandoned , “ to remove that veil which you wear . It seems out of harmony , someway , with the beauty and promise of the day . ” The young girl obediently yielded to her old companion 's wish and unpinning the cumbersome , sombre drapery from her bonnet , folded it neatly and laid it upon the seat in front of her . “ Ah ! that is better ; far better ! ” he said in a tone expressing unbounded relief . “ Never put it on again , dear . ” Octavie felt a little hurt ; as if he wished to debar her from share and parcel in the burden of affliction which had been placed upon all of them . Again she drew forth the old muslin handkerchief . They had left the big road and turned into a level plain which had formerly been an old meadow . There were clumps of thorn trees here and there , gorgeous in their spring radiance . Some cattle were grazing off in the distance in spots where the grass was tall and luscious . At the far end of the meadow was the towering lilac hedge , skirting the lane that led to Judge Pillier 's house , and the scent of its heavy blossoms met them like a soft and tender embrace of welcome . As they neared the house the old gentleman placed an arm around the girl 's shoulders and turning her face up to him he said : “ Do you not think that on a day like this , miracles might happen ? When the whole earth is vibrant with life , does it not seem to you , Octavie , that heaven might for once relent and give us back our dead ? ” He spoke very low , advisedly , and impressively . In his voice was an old quaver which was not habitual and there was agitation in every line of his visage . She gazed at him with eyes that were full of supplication and a certain terror of joy .",
